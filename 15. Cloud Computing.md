# Goal:
# Outline:
## 15. Cloud Computing
### Technology Landscape
Power Grid Inspiration for Computing: Deliver ICT services as “computing utilities” to users.
#### Living in an Exponential World
• Computing power
– Computer chips reaching while 200 billion transistors in some configurations (NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs)
– Exascale computing. El Capitan supercomputer has 1.742 exaflops
• Very high-speed networks
– 1.6 Terabit / second bandwidth in a metropolitan fiber network
– 1 Petabit / second if multiple router racks are set up in tandem
• Infinite storage
– Storage density doubles every 12 months
– Today: zetta era (10^21 bytes)
#### Distributed Computing Paradigms
1. We linked all machines together via Internet, TCP/IP
2. We linked all documents together via WWW, HTTP, HTML, XML
3. We linked all applications together via Web services, REST
4. Linking everything else together on the Grid
#### Evolution of Distributed Computing
Moving towards a Service Oriented Economy with new technological requirements
• Cloud Computing: “the next natural step in the evolution of on-demand
information technology services…”
• Requires a paradigm shift from Grid Computing to enable on-demand services.
• Key technological requirement for Clouds: virtualisation
### Towards a Definition of Cloud Computing
Clouds are a large pool of easily usable and
accessible **virtualised** resources
• These resources can be **dynamically** reconfigured to
adjust to a variable load (scale), allowing also for an
optimum resource utilisation (**elasticity**)
• This pool of resources is typically exploited by a **pay-**
**per-use** model in which guarantees are offered by
the infrastructure provider by means of customised
Service Level Agreements
A cloud infrastructure provides a
framework to manage scalable,
reliable, **on-demand** access to
applications
• A cloud is the “invisible” backend to
many of our **mobile** applications
#### Cloud Data Centers
• 10’s to 100’s of thousands of hosts, often closely
coupled, in close proximity:
– e-business (e.g. Amazon)
– content-servers (e.g., YouTube, Apple, Microsoft)
– search engines, data mining (e.g.,
Google)
❖ challenges:
▪ multiple applications, each
serving massive numbers of
clients
▪ managing/balancing load,
processing, networking, data
management
