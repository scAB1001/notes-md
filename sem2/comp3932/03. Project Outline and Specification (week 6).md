### 1. Title
A concise title that accurately describes the subject of your project.
The subject should be the computer science problem that you are investigating.
It should not be, for example, a software artefact (e.g. a mobile app or web site) – that is a
Deliverable of the project, and part of your solution, but not the subject.

*Replacing Joystick Control: A Hand-Gesture Based Navigation System for 3D Anatomy Manipulation in Virtual Reality*
### 2. Aim
A short paragraph describing the computer science problem that your project is
investigating.

You can describe the context of the problem but need to separate out the specifics of what
you will be studying.

This does not need to describe how you solve the problem or with what algorithms or tools,
unless that is fundamental to the work, e.g. your project is studying a particular algorithm or
technique.

---
The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate a hand-gesture based interaction system for intuitive 3D anatomical model manipulation in virtual reality, addressing the usability limitations of traditional joystick-controlled interfaces.

**Computer science problem:** Current 3D anatomical visualization systems rely on joystick-based navigation, which presents significant human-computer interaction challenges including non-intuitive control mappings, limited degrees of freedom, and high cognitive load during complex spatial manipulation tasks. These limitations result in steep learning curves and reduced efficiency in surgical planning applications where precise spatial understanding is critical.

**What will be produced:** A prototype VR system with integrated hand-gesture recognition for anatomical model navigation and a formal usability study comparing task completion times, error rates, along with a comparative evaluation of its usability against conventional joystick interfaces.
### 3. Objectives (up to 5)
Objectives should be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
Objectives should be a list of tasks that collectively meet the Aim of your project (makes
them Specific and Relevant)
Consider what you need to achieve to reach your Aim, as stages of your project.
Normal parts of the project such as literature review and report writing are not Objectives.

---
1. **Develop a 3D model preprocessing pipeline** that automatically repairs, simplifies, and optimizes anatomical meshes for real-time VR rendering while preserving critical topological features for surgical accuracy.
    
2. **Implement a real-time hand-gesture recognition system** using the Varjo XR-4/Magic Leap 2 APIs that accurately interprets complex 3D hand movements with precision for intuitive model manipulation.
    
3. **Design and develop a gesture-to-action mapping framework** that translates recognized hand movements into precise 3D navigation commands (rotation, zoom, pan, selection) with appropriate feedback and visual confirmation.
    
4. **Conduct a comparative usability evaluation** measuring task completion time, error rates, and user satisfaction between the hand-gesture interface and traditional joystick control with at least 10 participants from technical backgrounds.
    
5. **Optimize the integrated system performance** to achieve consistent high framerate rendering in VR while maintaining reasonable latency for gesture recognition to ensure a comfortable, user-friendly experience.
### 4. Deliverables (up to 5)
Deliverables are concrete items produced as part of your project. They are the evidence
required to show you have met your Objectives, and ultimately your Aim.
You should link them to your Objectives such that it is clear which Deliverable relates to
which objective (makes the Objective Measurable and Achievable).

Your final report and your software repository can both be considered Deliverables. You
may wish to further sub-divide this, for example if you project delivers several distinct
software items or particular chapters of your report are relevant.
This is the starting point for a plan, which you should also work on with your supervisor.

---
 1. Final report
 2. Software Repository
	 1. 3D mesh preprocessing toolkit with automated hole-filling, decimation, and optimization algorithms
	 2. Real-time hand gesture recognition module with trained models and calibration utilities
	 3. Unity-based VR integration framework with customizable gesture mappings
	 4. Performance benchmarking and testing suite
 3. Functional Prototype Application demonstrating complete workflow from model import to immersive hand-controlled navigation with support for multiple anatomical structures.
 4. Evaluation Dataset & Results including recorded user sessions, performance metrics, comparative analysis, and structured feedback from usability testing.
### 5. Plan
A schedule for your project from now until the final submission of the report (week 10 of
semester 2). Weekly is probably an appropriate level of planning for most people.
Use your Deliverables as milestones for your progress (makes the Objective Achievable and
Time-bound).

Allow time for completing evaluation of your work as well as completing development.
Allow time for writing up, and consider how you will write up – regularly and incrementally,
or later, once work is complete.

Please consider when there are other demands there are on your time, e.g. exams,
coursework, holidays.

### 6. Risk
A brief discussion of how to mitigate risk in your project and ensure sufficient work will be
completed for final submission.
This could include prioritisation of Objectives and Deliverables or development of
prototypes as early-stage deliverables.
This could include some contingency in your plan for delays.

---
**Key Project Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Scope Creep Risk** - The project could expand beyond what's achievable in the timeframe
    - **Mitigation**: Define a "minimum viable product" (MVP) upfront: basic rotation/zoom gestures with one anatomical model. Additional features (pan, selection, multiple models) are stretch goals only if time permits
    - **Mitigation**: Weekly progress reviews with supervisor to ensure focus remains on core objectives
2. **Technical Blockers Risk** - Hand tracking API integration or VR hardware issues could cause significant delays
    - **Mitigation**: Develop a "simulation mode" early that mimics hand gestures using mouse/keyboard, allowing continued development even if hardware is unavailable
    - **Mitigation**: Start with simple proof-of-concept integration in Week 1 to identify API issues immediately
3. **Time Management Risk** - Other coursework commitments could reduce project time
    - **Mitigation**: Use Gantt chart with buffer weeks (Weeks 8-9 of Semester 2) for catch-up
    - **Mitigation**: Prioritize writing dissertation concurrently with development (write Chapter 2 during development phase)
4. **Hardware Dependency Risk** - Limited lab access to Varjo XR-4/Magic Leap 2 headsets
    - **Mitigation**: Schedule lab time 2 weeks in advance and have backup development plan for Unity Editor testing
    - **Mitigation**: Document all hardware-specific code clearly to minimize rework if equipment changes
5. **Evaluation Failure Risk** - Difficulty recruiting participants for usability testing
    - **Mitigation**: Plan evaluation early (Week 3 Semester 2); have backup pool of computing students if medical professionals are unavailable
    - **Mitigation**: Design evaluation to require only 5-8 participants for meaningful results

**Prioritization Strategy (if delays occur):**
1. **Essential for submission**: Working gesture system with one model + basic evaluation + completed dissertation
2. **Can reduce**: Number of gesture types tested, number of evaluation participants, complexity of models used
3. **Can omit entirely**: Advanced features like mesh preprocessing automation, complex gesture mappings

**Early Prototyping**: A functional prototype demonstrating basic hand tracking will be completed by Week 9 of Semester 1, ensuring core technology viability before major development investment.

- Hand tracking accuracy issues: Some form of confidence scoring will be needed to assess accuracy
- Performance bottlenecks: Progressive mesh loading may severely impact the system; maintain joystick compatibility as backup
- VR motion sickness: Include comfort settings (snap turning, reduced movement); rigorous testing with multiple users early in development
### 7. Ethics
Describe the ethical issues associated with your project and how you will address them.
For example, proper handling of data sets, user testing, etc.
There is a lecture in Week 6 that you must attend and a further advice session in Week 7 if
you need guidance on how to properly consider ethics.
If you believe there are no ethical issues associated with your project you should state that
here.

---
- User Testing: All participants will provide informed consent; right to withdraw at any time; no medical professionals required for initial testing
- Health and Safety: VR usage guidelines provided; regular breaks enforced; participants screened for epilepsy or motion sickness susceptibility
- Intellectual Property: Clear acknowledgment of university and individual contributions; no use of proprietary medical data.
Ethical approval is required for the user-testing portion.

#### Alternative if you're **only** doing technical testing (no human participants)
**Ethical Considerations:**
Given that this project involves:
- No human participants in testing
- No access to medical or personal data
- Only publicly available, anonymized 3D models
- Technical performance evaluation only (no user studies)

**There are no significant ethical concerns requiring formal approval.** Any system testing will be conducted by the researcher only, focusing on technical metrics (frame rates, tracking accuracy) rather than human factors.

**However,** if user testing is added later, formal ethical approval will be sought through the appropriate university channels before any participant recruitment begins.
