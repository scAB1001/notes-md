# Goal:
# Outline:
## 15. Cloud Computing
### Technology Landscape
Power Grid Inspiration for Computing: Deliver ICT services as “computing utilities” to users.
#### Living in an Exponential World
• Computing power
– Computer chips reaching while 200 billion transistors in some configurations (NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs)
– Exascale computing. El Capitan supercomputer has 1.742 exaflops
• Very high-speed networks
– 1.6 Terabit / second bandwidth in a metropolitan fiber network
– 1 Petabit / second if multiple router racks are set up in tandem
• Infinite storage
– Storage density doubles every 12 months
– Today: zetta era (10^21 bytes)
#### Distributed Computing Paradigms
1. We linked all machines together via Internet, TCP/IP
2. We linked all documents together via WWW, HTTP, HTML, XML
3. We linked all applications together via Web services, REST
4. Linking everything else together on the Grid
#### Evolution of Distributed Computing
Moving towards a Service Oriented Economy with new technological requirements
• Cloud Computing: “the next natural step in the evolution of on-demand
information technology services…”
• Requires a paradigm shift from Grid Computing to enable on-demand services.
• Key technological requirement for Clouds: virtualisation
### Towards a Definition of Cloud Computing
Clouds are a large pool of easily usable and
accessible **virtualised** resources
• These resources can be **dynamically** reconfigured to
adjust to a variable load (scale), allowing also for an
optimum resource utilisation (**elasticity**)
• This pool of resources is typically exploited by a **pay-**
**per-use** model in which guarantees are offered by
the infrastructure provider by means of customised
Service Level Agreements
A cloud infrastructure provides a
framework to manage scalable,
reliable, **on-demand** access to
applications
• A cloud is the “invisible” backend to
many of our **mobile** applications
#### Cloud Data Centers
• 10’s to 100’s of thousands of hosts, often closely
coupled, in close proximity:
– e-business (e.g. Amazon)
– content-servers (e.g., YouTube, Apple, Microsoft)
– search engines, data mining (e.g.,
Google)
Challenges:
▪ multiple applications, each
serving massive numbers of
clients
▪ managing/balancing load,
processing, networking, data
management
### Virtualised infrastructures
#### Virtualised infrastructures Benefits
• Virtualized Service Platforms
– Consolidation of server systems
– Reduced costs
– Reduced complexity
– Simplified administration
– Pay-per-usage
#### Cloud Computing - Benefits
• Technological
– On-demand scaling of resources
– Real-time reaction to increases in demand (elasticity)
– Hardware consolidation, homogeneity no longer
necessary, lock in avoidable
– Simple hardware provisioning
– Resource transparency (automation / fault tolerance
### Conceptual Cloud Architecture
![[concept-cloud-vision.png\|300]]
![[layered-cloud-arch.png\|300]]
### Taxonomy of cloud Models
Cloud Architectures are comprised of three service layers, services
can be exposed at any layer, lower layers hidden from end user

Layer 1: **Software as a Service** (SaaS)
– This is an alternative to locally run
applications. Software packages run
remotely, e.g. Google Apps
• Layer 2: **Platform as a Service** (PaaS)
– Software stack facilitating the deployment
of applications, e.g. M$ Azure
• Layer 3: **Infrastructure as a Service** (IasS)
– Through virtualization, infrastructure
providers are able to split, assign and
dynamically manage service Providers,
that will deploy on these systems the
software stacks that run their services
Virtualised resource manager, e.g. Amazon
#### Cloud Architecture
![[typical-cloud-arch.png]]
#### System Level: Architecture of a Server Cluster ( ~ 1000 servers)
Interconnected by an Ethernet switch and housed in a warehouse or
in a container environment: 1U server, 7 rack servers with Ethernet swith and a small cluster with an Ethernet switch/router.
### Virtual Infrastructure Managers
- VMs are great...but something more is needed
	- Where did/do I put my VM? (**scheduling & monitoring**)
	- How do I provision a new cluster node? (**clone**)
	- What MAC addresses are available? (**networking**)
- Provides a **uniform view** of the resource pool
- **Life-cycle management** and monitoring of VM
- The VIM **integrates** Image, Network and Virtualization
#### OpenStack
Cloud OS that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed and provisioned through APIs with common authentication mechanisms.
![[openstack-ex.png]]
Dashboards are also available, giving administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface. There are [OpenStack CLI tools and SDKs](https://developer.openstack.org/) giving operators the flexibility to create OpenStack cloud applications in the language of their choice. Supported languages include Go, Python, Ruby, and Java.

Beyond standard infrastructure-as-a-service functionality, additional components provide orchestration, fault management and service management amongst other services to provide operators flexibility to customize their infrastructure and ensure high availability of user applications
### Cloud services

| Virtual Machine     | Container                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ![[vm-arch-ex.png]] | ![[container-arch-ex.png]] |
• Container-based virtualisation
– uses a single kernel to run multiple instances of an OS
– Each instance runs in a completely isolated environment
• Can offer greater efficiency and performance than a conventional
hypervisor
#### The Case of Containers
• Container virtualizes the OS rather than the hardware
• Inside the container is a single executable service that is a small part of an
application: a microservice
• Microservices provide a simple function from a single piece of executable code.
• Applications are made up of a collection of microservices
– each provides a small part of the overall application.
• Multiple copies of a single microservice may be run in many containers, and
those containers are linked together with message queuing or load balancing.
• Application itself is built to cope with individual container failure and each
container has its own instance of the microservice software code.
• Examples:
– Docker https://www.docker.com/
– Singularity http://singularity.lbl.gov
• Need for a container-orchestration system for automating
application deployment, scaling, and management,
e.g. Kubernetes
