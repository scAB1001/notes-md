## 12. Consistency and Replication Pt.1 - *Chapter 7*
### Introduction to the problem
 An important issue in distributed systems is the
**replication** of data
– Example: multiple copies of the same file
• Data are generally replicated to
– **Enhance reliability**: what if one replica crashes?
– **Improve performance**: an increasing number of processes
need to access data managed by a single server
• One of the major problems is **keeping replicas consistent**
– This means that when one copy is updated we need to
ensure that the other copies are updated as well
– otherwise the replicas will no longer be the same
