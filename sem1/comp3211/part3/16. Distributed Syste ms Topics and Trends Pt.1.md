# Goal: Understand concepts surrounding ubiquitous clouds
# Outline:
## 16. Distributed Syste ms Topics and Trends Pt.1
Clouds are the base for
providing future Internet services
• Future Internet covers not
only people and machines but
also any objects or things.
• Internet of Things (IoT)
applications are still emerging
• they must leverage clouds in
processing and storage of
massive amount of data,
dynamically
### IoT: the Internet of Things
Kevin Ashton (1999) coined "Internet of Things"
phrase to describe a system where the Internet is
connected to the physical world via ubiquitous
sensors
Prediction (IDC Report):
“IoT Installed Base Will Grow to 40 Billion Units By
2025. This will generate 80 ZettaBytes (ZB) of
data”
