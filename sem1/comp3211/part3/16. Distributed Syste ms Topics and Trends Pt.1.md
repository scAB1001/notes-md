# Goal: Understand concepts surrounding ubiquitous clouds
# Outline:
## 16. Distributed Syste ms Topics and Trends Pt.1
Clouds are the base for
providing future Internet services
• Future Internet covers not
only people and machines but
also any objects or things.
• Internet of Things (IoT)
applications are still emerging
• they must leverage clouds in
processing and storage of
massive amount of data,
dynamically
### IoT: the Internet of Things
Kevin Ashton (1999) coined "Internet of Things"
phrase to describe a system where the Internet is
connected to the physical world via ubiquitous
sensors
Prediction (IDC Report):
“IoT Installed Base Will Grow to 40 Billion Units By
2025. This will generate 80 ZettaBytes (ZB) of
data”
IoT Telemedicine Applications example
#### How to Integrate a Fridge into IoT
Add the basics … some sensors built in that tells
• when the water filter need replacing
• if the doors are shut
• if they are open for a certain amount of
time:
➢ start a timer
➢ An alarm goes off
• … this requires some kind of
computational intelligence
• Make
use of barcode and RFID (radio Frequency  
Identification) scanning  
• Add more sensors, e.g. weight and … cameras  
• Example 1: A camera in the butter tray can sense  
when the butter is low  
• Test the weight of the butter  
• Send a warning when this happens  
• Example 2: Have a set of recipes programmed into  
the fridge  
• It can suggest recipes based on the food it sees  
inside  
• Nice features to have which require  
• Local sensing  
• local processing  
• … again this requires some kind of  
computational intelligence
IoT fridge = **computational intelligence + network connectivity**
• **Network connectivity** you can add another set of
features
• When the stock is low
• Voice (talking fridge)
• Send an SMS
• Order food
• How can food be ordered?
• go straight to a designated online supermarket
• Can check first for the cheapest (using Web
services?)
• Place the order, grab money out of the bank
account, transfer it to whoever food is
purchased from
• Food is delivered the next day on the doorstep.

### Edge Computing
2- Disruptive Applications:
New Requirements
• IoT applications and devices
continue to proliferate
• The “data warehouse” model
cannot
– keep up with the data volume
and velocity created by IoT
devices
– meet the low latency response
times that users demand.
• Sending the data to the cloud for
analysis also poses a risk of **data**
**bottlenecks**
• Increase in network traffic causes
the problem of **data congestion**
• New business models need **data**
**analytics** in a minute or less (with
some use cases of even less than a
second)
**(CLOUD->EDGE)**
IoT brings together:  
• Cloud computing  
• Data-centre based  
• Massively scalable  
using virtualised  
infrastructure  
• Edge computing  
• Geographically  
localised servers  
• Brings computing  
closer to end devices  

**(EXAMPLE)** Driverless Cars
A combination of enormous amounts of sensor data, critical local processing
power
• Essential need to connect back to more advanced data analysis tools in the cloud
• Appearance of entirely new types of distributed computing architectures that can
break up large workloads across different elements
• big data analytics
• real-time applications
• …
• Coordination of several different layers of computing, including pieces that live out
on the **edge**.

**(Network-edge computing)**

Data is Monitored, Analysed, Reduced and Cached.
### Revisiting the Cloud Computing Stack

### Vision for a (near) future
Edge-Driven Future for Supercomputing
New **Disruptive** Applications,  High Performance **Exascale** Computing 
Data Center **Cloud**
Network Core
Multi-service **Edge**
Embedded Systems & Sensors (**IoT devices**)

• Edge computing is a crucial part of delivering value for exascale
• is seen as a device for turning an I/O-bound problem into a compute-bound
problem
• It is more efficient to examine data at the edge and filter only the important or
interesting data to supercomputers for heavy-duty analysis
#### Intelligent Distributed Systems: the Future
**Disruptive** Applications -> **Supporting** Infrastructure -> Move towards
**Exascale/Zetascale** -> Intelligent DS.
