### Evolution of distributed computing
El Capitan: Fastest Exascale Supercomputer
• Breaks exascale barrier at 1.742 exaflops/s
• 11,039,616 combined CPU and GPU cores
• based on AMD 4th generation EPYC processors with 24 cores at 1.8GHz and AMD Instinct accelerators
#### Scalability in Size - Serving Users
Youtube: 1 billion hours of videos watched / day
TikTok: Accessed by over 0.75 billion users in China alone
Google: 8.5 billion searches every day
Ticketmaster: 2 million tickets sold in one day (Eras Tour)
Note: this year, the amount of data generated each day is expected to reach 400 exabytes globally.
### Most Active Topics in Distributed Syste ms
Shaped by trends in
• Cloud computing
• Edge computing
• AI
• Security
• Ultra-scale architectures
#### 1- Edge-Cloud Continuum
Key technology to support the Internet of Things, e.g. autonomous vehicles
New requirements:
• Ultra-low-latency execution models for Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality,
autonomous vehicles, and 6G.
• Distributed orchestration across heterogeneous nodes (cloud → edge)
