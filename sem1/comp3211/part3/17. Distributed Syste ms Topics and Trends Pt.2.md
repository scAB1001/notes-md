### Evolution of distributed computing
El Capitan: Fastest Exascale Supercomputer
• Breaks exascale barrier at 1.742 exaflops/s
• 11,039,616 combined CPU and GPU cores
• based on AMD 4th generation EPYC processors with 24 cores at 1.8GHz and AMD Instinct accelerators
#### Scalability in Size - Serving Users
Youtube: 1 billion hours of videos watched / day
TikTok: Accessed by over 0.75 billion users in China alone
Google: 8.5 billion searches every day
Ticketmaster: 2 million tickets sold in one day (Eras Tour)
Note: this year, the amount of data generated each day is expected to reach 400 exabytes globally.
### Most Active Topics in Distributed Syste ms
Shaped by trends in
• Cloud computing
• Edge computing
• AI
• Security
• Ultra-scale architectures
#### 1- Edge-Cloud Continuum
Key technology to support the Internet of Things, e.g. autonomous vehicles
New requirements:
• Ultra-low-latency execution models for Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality,
autonomous vehicles, and 6G.
• Distributed orchestration across heterogeneous nodes (cloud → edge)

#### 2- Intelligent Distributed Systems
**Disruptive** Applications -> **Supporting** Infrastructure -> Move towards
**Exascale/Zetascale** -> Intelligent DS.

• AI for systems: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) / agentic AI for scheduling,
autoscaling, anomaly detection, self-repair, and code generation for distributed
infrastructure.
• Systems for AI: New architectures to support distributed training, e.g. GPU
clusters, Tensor Processor Units, high-bandwidth interconnects.
#### 3- Serverless and Event-Driven Architectures
• **Issues**: fine-grained autoscaling for stateful serverless functions, cold-start elimination, and multi- cloud serverless portability
• The case for **WASM** - WebAssembly
• **Lightweight**, binary instruction format that runs safely and efficiently across edge/cloud
• WASM modules are compact and initialise in milliseconds - **fast**
• write code once and run it across multiple environments - **portable**
#### - Reliability, Consistency, and Correctness at Scale
• New Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (**CRDT**) and consistency protocols beyond Raft / Paxos for large scale distributed systems
• replicas are updated independently, concurrently and without coordinating with other replicas
• Inconsistencies automatically resolved – convergence guaranteed
• Techniques for verifying correctness in microservice and multi-agent systems.
#### 5- Secure Large Scale Distributed Systems
• **Challenges** due to decentralisation, heterogeneity, and high dynamism.
• Distributed identity and access management for **agentic AI** workloads
• **Confidential computing**: protects data while it is being processed by
encrypting it in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
#### 6- Think Sustainability?
It costs 0.0002kWh of energy
to stream 1 minute of video
from the Youtube data centre.

0.01kWh of energy is consumed
on average in downloading 1GB
over the Internet.

The average Internet device
energy consumption is around
0.001kWh in 1 minute of
video stream

Using the number of downloads,
transferring this 70MB file and
streaming for 2 minutes gives the
full energy cost in streaming this
one video since June 2016!

51TWh, more than the annual electricity consumption
of Morocco (44TWh), population 38M (2025)
**(Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Distributed Computing - Solutions)**
- Hardware: e.g. DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling)
- Operating System e.g. Power saving techniques
- Datacenters: Turn-off idle servers, Virtual Machine consolidation, VM scheduling
- Virtualization:e.g. Xen Hypervisor
- Energy efficient: network protocols, software design
