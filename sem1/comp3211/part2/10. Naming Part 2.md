Recap: Classes of Naming Systems
1. Flat naming
a. Broadcasting
b. Forwarding pointers
c. Home-based approaches
d. Distributed Hash Tables
e. Hierarchical approaches
2. Structured naming (this lecture)
3. Attribute-based naming (this lecture)
#### Goals: 
understand principles behind naming in a distributed system
#### Outline
• Structured naming
– Namespaces
– Name resolution
– Implementation of a namespace
Examples
• Attribute-based naming
• Directory Services
• Conclusion
#### Flat vs Structured Naming
• Flat names are
– good for machines
– generally not very convenient for humans to use
• Alternative:
– Naming systems support structured names that are composed from single, human-readable names
– File naming, host naming on the Internet follows this approach.
• Next
– Explore how structured names and the way that these names are resolved to addresses.
#### Namespaces
• A namespace is the collection of all valid names recognised by a particular service.
• Namespaces for structured names can be represented as a directed graph with leaf nodes (no outgoing edges) and directory nodes (labelled outgoing edges).
• Leaf nodes store entity attributes or state of entity itself; directory nodes store a directory table of outgoing edges.
• Each path in naming graph can be identified by sequence of labels associated with edges in the path: N : {L1, L2, …, Ln}

*A directory node contains a table of (node identifier, edge label) pairs*

We can easily store all kinds of attributes in a node
• Type of the entity
• An identifier for that entity
• Address of the entity’s location
• Nicknames …

#### Name Resolution
• Name resolution: is the process of looking up a name
• Problem: To resolve a name we need a directory node. How do we actually find that (initial) node?
• Closure mechanism: The mechanism to select the implicit context from which to start name resolution
Examples:
– www.distributed-systems.net: start at a DNS name server
– /home/maarten/mbox: start at the local NFS file server (possible recursive search)
– 0031 20 598 7784: dial a phone number
– 77.167.55.6: route message to a specific IP address
#### Closure Mechanism (Unix)
• Name resolution possible only if we know how and where to start, i.e. need some way of selecting initial node (index node).
• In a UNIX file system, we exploit fact that the inode of the root directory is first inode of logical disk, and that its byte offset can be computed from information in disk’s superblock.

*To resolve /home/steen/mbox : necessary to have access to the directory table of the root node.*
#### File Structures and Name Resolution (Unix)
Every file and directory is represented by an **inode**
• Contains two kinds of information:
1. **Metadata** describing the file's owner, access rights, etc.
2. **Location** of the file's blocks on disk
• A **directory** is a flat file of fixed-size entries
	• Each entry consists of an inode number and a file name
##### Pathname Resolution
To look up a pathname “/etc/passwd”, start at root directory and walk down chain of inodes

#### Linking
• We can create **aliases** for a named entity, corresponding to links in the naming graph:
![[linking-unix-ex.png]]
– Can have multiple *absolute* pathnames referring to same node (‘**hard link**’ in UNIX filesystem terminology)
– Can have leaf node of alias store the *absolute* pathname of the aliased entity (‘**symbolic link**’)
#### Mounting
• Name resolution can be used to merge different namespaces in a transparent way through mounting: associating a node identifier of another name space with a node in a current name space.
• Terminology
– Foreign name space: the name space that needs to be accessed
– Mount point: the node in the current name space containing the node identifier of the foreign name space
– Mounting point: the node in the foreign name space where to continue name resolution
• Mounting across a network
– The name of an access protocol
– The name of the server
– The name of the mounting point in the foreign name space.

*Mounting remote name spaces through a specific access protocol Resolve name /remote/vu/mbox*
#### Namespace Implementation
Basic issue
• Distribute the name resolution process as well as name space management across multiple machines, by distributing nodes of the naming graph.
Distinguish three levels
• **Global** level: Consists of the high-level directory nodes. Main aspect is that these directory nodes have to be jointly managed by different administrations
• **Administrational** level: Contains mid-level directory nodes that can be grouped in such a way that each group can be assigned to a separate administration.
• **Managerial** level: Consists of low-level directory nodes within a single administration. Main issue is effectively mapping directory nodes to local name servers.
*Example: DNS Partitioning*
