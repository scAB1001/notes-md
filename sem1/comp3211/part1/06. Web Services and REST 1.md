#### Distributed Computing Paradigms & Web Services
• First
– We linked all machines together - > Internet
– Needed TCP/IP
• Second
– we linked all documents together - >WWW
– Needed HTTP, HTML, XML
• Third
– we linked all applications together
– Service Oriented Architectures -> Web services
– Needed
• REST (Representational State Transfer)
#### Why Do We Need Web Services?
• ‘Screen scraping’ a Website, i.e., treating it like a
remote database is (still) popular
– but is inherently unreliable
– there is a need to query Web resources programmatically
• DS technologies must support industry requirements
• Industry has moved rapidly to adoption of data
encoding formats for describing and exchanging data,
e.g.
– XML (Extensible Markup Language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
• DS technology based on these formats is attractive.
#### What are Web Services?
• A Web service is a piece of business logic, located
on the Internet or on an intranet, accessed using
e.g. standard XML, over standard protocols such
as HTTP or SMTP
• Web services do not replace other DS
technologies
– more coarse-grained approach to exposing and
advertising enterprise services hosted on existing
platforms such as JEE, .NET, etc.
• Web services allow us to build larger-scale,
loosely-coupled DS without constraining
technology used to develop system components.
#### Why Use XML For Structuring
and Exchanging Data?
• Easily extended
• Allows data to be self-describing
• Text-based, therefore portable and human-friendly
• Standard and non-proprietary
<employee>
<firstname>John</firstname>
<lastname>Smith</lastname>
</employee>
#### Why Use JSON For Structuring
and Exchanging Data?
• JSON: JavaScript Object Notation is
– lightweight text-data interchange format
– language independent
– "self-describing“
– Easy to understand
{
"employees": [
{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },
{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },
{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" }
]
}
#### Service Oriented Architecture
• Web services support
development of a highly-
distributed, Service-Oriented
Architecture (SOA); each WS
is a self-contained, self-
describing modular unit
participating in a larger
ecosystem.
• Three roles for participants in an SOA:
– Provider, who publishes a service via a broker
– Requestor, who uses the broker to find, then bind to, a service
– Broker, acting as a ‘Yellow Pages’ directory for services
Example: Finding (REST) APIs:
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer
![[soa-web-services.png]]
##### Example: Book a Flight and Car
1. Runs a booking system on Oracle Solaris
2. Runs website and online booking system on Linux Dell Servers
1.WS Client->2.WS
Although the systems have different h/w and s/w, they can be loosely
coupled with WS, to the business benefit of both companies.
True SOA takes this a stage further, allowing for **dynamic discovery** of
services via brokerage.

• Platform and implementation independent -Meaning that a client can not tell what language, operating system, or computer platform was used. A software components that can be:
– Described using a service description language, Meaning that a Web Service must describe itself:
◼ What requests can be made,
◼ What the arguments are,
◼ What transport it uses
– Published to a registry of services, Meaning that a Web Service must tell a registry service where it is located (like "yellow pages").
– Discovered through a standard mechanism (at runtime or design time), Meaning that a potential client can find it in a registry service.
– Invoked through a declared API, usually over a network Meaning that the arguments and return types are known
– Composed with other services Meaning that a service can also be a client.
(FEATURES) Standardise the packaging of information for transport
– E.g. over HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc, using XML, JSON …
• Support modes of communication
– e.g. synchronous (RPC-style) and asynchronous (document transfer)
• Provide an interoperability abstraction of conventional RPC /
RMI
#### Resource-based Architectures
Essence: view a distributed system as a **collection of resources**,
individually managed by components. Resources may be added,
removed, retrieved, and modified by (remote) applications.
• Resources are identified through a single naming scheme
• All services offer the same interface
• Messages sent to or from a service are fully self-described
• After executing an operation at a service, that component forgets
everything about the caller
Approach adopted in Representational State Transfer (**REST**) Web
services, with the following basic operations

| Operation | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST      | Create a new resource                                   |
| GET       | Retrieve the state of a resource in some representation |
| DELETE    | Delete a resource                                       |
| PUT       | Modify a resource by transferring new state             |
REST is an architectural style for DS
What Does REST Consist of?
• The uniform interface features a constrained
set of well-defined operations and a
constrained set of content types.
• REST uses a protocol that is client/server,
stateless, cacheable and layered.
• The REST methodology is identical to the
way in which a Web browser gets Web
pages from or posts to a web server.
• An example...
##### In Practice... (I)
• A Web page is a resource. So is a jpeg picture file
located on that Web page. So are any links, sound files
• Resources are accessible using a universal syntax – the
URI.
– URIs are assigned to individual data records, customer records,
and orders, as transferred between a Web Service and a Client.
https ://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?**method**=flickr.photos.getinfo&**photoID**=1234
![[rest-ex.png]]The well-defined operations supported by REST
resources are simply HTTP verbs, the most
important of which are GET, POST, PUT and
DELETE.
• Used to issue a request to a REST Web Service to
access and manipulate the server-side state, or
data record, identified by the URI.
• These verbs can be seen as being similar to the
CRUD operations associated with DBMS.
– GET = READ or COPY
– PUT = UPDATE or PASTE OVER
– POST = CREATE or PASTE AFTER
– DELETE = DELETE or CUT
The “REST triangle”
![[rest-triangle.png]]
- REST is not a standard – it’s an architectural style,
although it does prescribe the use of standards
(HTTP, URI, XML/HTML/JPEG etc)
#### Why is it called "Representation State Transfer"?
The Client references a Web resource using a URL. A representation
of the resource is returned (in this case as an HTML document).
The representation (e.g., Boeing787.html) places the client application in
a state. The result of the client traversing a hyperlink in Boeing787.html
in another resource is accessed. The new representation places the client
application into yet another state. Thus, the client application changes (transfers)
state with each resource representation --> Representation State Transfer!

#### The REST way of Implementing the Web Services
Consider a Parts Depot Web Service, which allows its customers to:
1. Get a list of parts
2. Get detailed information about a particular part
3. Submit a purchase order (PO)
![[rest-purchase-order-ex.png]]
Get a list of parts
• A RESTful web service makes a URI available to its parts list resource. So you’d access something like: http://www.parts-depot.com/parts
• If the service wishes to specify what type of document the user wants… http://www.parts-depot.com/parts?flavour=xml
Data Returned - Parts List
```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<p:Parts xmlns:p="http://www.parts-depot.com"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation=
"http://www.parts-depot.com
http://www.parts-depot.com/parts.xsd">
<Part id="00345" xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345"/>
<Part id="00346" xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00346"/>
<Part id="00347" xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00347"/>
<Part id="00348" xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00348"/>
</p:Parts>
```
Note that the parts list has links to get detailed info about each part.
This is a key feature of REST. The client transfers from one state to
the next by examining and choosing from among the alternative URLs
in the response document.
(EXAMPLE) Get information about a particular part
• The RESTful Web Service makes available a URI to each part resource, such as:
http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345?flavour=xml
• This is a logical URI – it expresses what resource is desired. It is not a physical object. You don’t need a million HTML pages if you have a million parts.
Data Returned:
```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<p:Part xmlns:p="http://www.parts-depot.com"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation=
"http://www.parts-depot.com
http://www.parts-depot.com/part.xsd">
<Part-ID>00345</Part-ID>
<Name>Widget-A</Name>
<Description>This part is used within the frap assembly</Description>
<Specification xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345/specification"/>
<UnitCost currency="USD">0.10</UnitCost>
<Quantity>10</Quantity>
</p:Part>
```
Observe how this data is linked to still more data - the specification
for this part may be found by traversing the hyperlink. Each response
document allows the client to drill down to get more detailed information.
• **Service: Submit a Purchase Order (PO)**
– The web service makes available a URL to submit a PO.
The client creates a PO instance document which
conforms to the PO schema that Parts Depot has
designed (and publicised in a WSDL document). The
client submits PO.xml as the payload of an HTTP POST.
![[web-service-pruchase-order.png]]Claimed Benefits
• Advocates of REST claim:
– Provides improved response times due to support for
caching
– Improves server scalability by reducing the need to
maintain communication state (i.e. different servers can
handle initial and subsequent requests).
– Depends less on vendor software than mechanisms that
layer additional messaging frameworks on top of HTTP
– Does not require a separate resource discovery
mechanism due to use of hyperlinks in content.
Conclusion
• Web services support loose coupling of systems, facilitating
an SOA for the Internet
• REST has become the standard for implementing Web
Services
• Many companies are offering their Web services using REST,
e.g. Tweets, Search API, Maps, live, photos, traffic
• REST is very attractive for applications that involve high levels
of interoperability between multiple platforms.
#### EXTRA MATERIAL – HTTP
The HTTP API – Additional Verbs
• HEAD
– “Give me the metadata”
• TRACE
– “Show me what changes have been made”
• OPTIONS
– “What verbs have you implemented for this
resource?”
• PATCH
– “Apply partial resource modification”
*Anatomy of an HTTP Request*![[anatomy-of-http-req.png]]`<VERB>` is one of the HTTP verbs, `<URI>` is the
resource location
• `<Request Header>` contains metadata
– Collection of key-value pairs of headers and their values.
– Information about the message and its sender like client
type, the formats client supports, format type of the
message body, cache settings for the response, and more.
• `<Request Body>` is the actual message content (JSON, XML).
(EXAMPLE)
![[get-post-req-ex.png]]
*Anatomy of an HTTP Response*
![[anatomy-of-http-resp.png]]
Response code> contains request status. 3-
digit HTTP status code from a pre-defined list.
• `<Response Header>` contains metadata and
settings about the response message.
• `<Response Body>` contains the representation
if the request was successful
(EXAMPLE)
