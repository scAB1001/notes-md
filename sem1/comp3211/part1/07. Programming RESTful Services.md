## 7. Programming RESTful Web Services
### REST: Quick Recap
REST: Quick Recap  
• REST is an architectural style which is based on Web  
standards and the HTTP protocol  
• In a REST based architecture  
– Everything is a resource  
– A resource is accessed via a common interface based on the HTTP  
– The REST server provides access to the resources  
– The REST client accesses and modify the REST resources.  
• Resource  
– Should support the HTTP common operations.  
– Is identified by global IDs (which are typically URIs).  
• REST allows that resources have different representations,  
e.g. text, XML, JSON etc  
• The rest client can ask for specific representation via the  
HTTP protocol  
• See example: Purchase Order

The REST way of Implementing  
the Web Service
HTTP Methods
• PUT, GET, POST and DELETE methods are typical
used in REST based architectures.
– GET defines a reading access of the resource without
side-effects
– POST creates a new resource
– DELETE removes the resources
– PUT updates an existing resource or creates a new
resource.
RESTful Web Services - Examples
• Google REST API
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer
• X (previously Twitter) REST API
https://developer.x.com/en/docs/api-reference-index
• Amazon RESTful API
https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguid
e/apigateway-rest-api.html
• Perseverance/MARS2020 REST API
https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=53277.0
• OpenAI Platform RESTful APIs
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction
### REST APIs: Examples
Google extensively supports REST services
https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest
• See
– Actual API
– URL
– Connection
– Request method
– Character encoding
– Result (JSON format)
### Reference implementations:
#### Python Framework (Flask Restful)
• Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for
quickly building REST APIs
https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/
• It requires Python
• Useful links
– Installation Web page
– Example showing CRUD operations
Flask-RESTful: API Example
$ python api.py runs on port 5000
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/
{"hello": "world"}
CRUD Resource: Example
$ curl http://localhost:5000/todo1 -d "data=Remember the milk" -X PUT
{"todo1": "Remember the milk"}
$ curl http://localhost:5000/todo1
{"todo1": "Remember the milk"}
• CRUD resource for a
todo application
• Resources are built on
top of Flask pluggable
views
#### Java (Jersey)
Java and REST
• Java defines REST support via the Java
Specification Request 311 (JSR)
• This specification is called JAX-RS: Java API for
RESTful Web Services
• JAX-RS uses annotations to define the REST
relevance of Java classes
• JAX-RS supports the creation of XML and JSON
via the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB).
Frameworks: Jersey
• Jersey is the reference implementation for JAX-RS
https://jersey.github.io/
• Jersey contains basically a REST server and a REST client
– The core client can be used provides a library to communicate with the
server
• On the server side Jersey uses a servlet which scans
predefined classes to identify RESTful resources
• The base URL of this servlet is:
http://your_domain:port/display-name/url-pattern/path_from_rest_class
Note: Other Java based implementation frameworks include
• RESTEasy: JBoss project http://resteasy.jboss.org
• Struts Rest plugin: Apache project http://struts.apache.org/plugins/rest/
• …
JAX-RS Annotations

| Annotation                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @PATH(your_path)                                        | Sets the path to base URL + /your_path. The base URL is based on the application name, the servlet and the URL pattern                                                                                  |
| @POST                                                   | Indicates that the following method will answer to a HTTP POST request                                                                                                                                  |
| @GET                                                    | Indicates that the following method will answer to a HTTP GET request                                                                                                                                   |
| @PUT                                                    | Indicates that the following method will answer to a HTTP PUT request                                                                                                                                   |
| @DELETE                                                 | Indicates that the following method will answer to a HTTP DELETE request                                                                                                                                |
| @Produces(MediaType<br>.TEXT_PLAIN [, more-<br>types ]) | @Produces defines which MIME type is delivered by a<br>method annotated with @GET. In this example text<br>("text/plain") is produced. Other examples would be "application/xml" or "application/json". |
| @Consumes(type [,<br>more-types ])                      | @Consumes defines which MIME type is consumed by this method.                                                                                                                                           |
#### Example: Simple Calculator
• Create a Java Calculator class with operations ‘add’ and
‘subtract’
• Expose these as Restful Web services which accepts HTTP
GET Requests and sends the response as XML or Plain Text
• The Restful web service is made available at
http://localhost:9999/calcrest/calc/add/
http://localhost:9999/calcrest/calc/sub/
Example: Steps
1. Create the Restful Web Service
2. Publish the Restful Web Service
3. Create a Restful Web Service Client
See code available on Minerva
1- Create the Restful Web Service
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
@Path("/calc")
public class CalcREST {
@GET
@Path("/add/{a}/{b}")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String addPlainText(@PathParam("a") double a, @PathParam("b") double b)
{
return (a + b) + "";
}
@GET
@Path("/add/{a}/{b}")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_XML)
public String add(@PathParam("a") double a, @PathParam("b") double b) {
return "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>" + "<result>" + (a + b) + "</result>";
}
...
}
2- Publish the Restful Web Service
```java

import java.io.IOException;

public class CalcRESTStartUp {
	static final String BASE_URI = "http://localhost:9999/calcrest/";
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			HttpServer server = HttpServerFactory.create(BASE_URI);
			server.start();
			System.out.println("Press Enter to stop the server. ");
			System.in.read();
			server.stop(0);
		} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace(); }
	}
}
```
