Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) Guiding Principles
EDA is unboxing for
data!
“Exploratory data analysis is an
attitude, a state of flexibility, a
willingness to look for those things
that we believe are not there, as well
as those that we believe to be there.”
– John Tukey

Example
Objective: Predict the survival of the
passengers aboard RMS Titanic.
Dataset: Titanic DataSet
• provides the data on all the passengers
who were aboard the RMS Titanic when it
sank on 15 April 1912 after colliding with
an iceberg in the North Atlantic ocean.
○ a combination of variables based on personal
characteristics such as age, class of ticket and
gender, and tests one’s classification skills.
○ 891 rows and 12 columns

Visualizations and Simple Metrics
Typically, a good analytics project starts (after cleaning and understanding the
data) with exploratory visualizations that help you develop hypotheses and get
a feel for the data.
• Then you carefully manicure figures that make the final results visually
obvious.
Today:
• We will cover several of the most important visualization techniques.
• We will also cover some exploratory metrics (such as correlations), which
capture some of the patterns that are clear from a good visual
• Our eyes can trick us, so it’s important to have a cold hard statistic too.
○ We will cover some standard statistical metrics

matplotlib
The main visualization tool for Python is a
library called matplotlib.
• the most standard tool
• sufficient for most data science
• integrates well with the other libraries
• powerful, flexible
vs.
• Syntax is not intuitive
• Interactivity
pandas
Pandas is a library written for the Python programming language for
data manipulation and analysis.
• Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical
tables and time series.
• Visualizations
○ wrapper‐around matplotlib
Typically, you make an image by calling the plot() method on a Pandas
object, and Pandas does all the image formatting under the hood.
Then you use matplotlib’s pyplot module for things such as setting the
title and the final act of either displaying the image or saving it to a file.
Numpy
Numpy is a library for the Python programming language,
adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and
matrices, along with a large collection of high-level
mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
○ Highly optimized library use for numerical
computation
Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for
the Python programming language
• features various classification, regression and clustering
algorithms including support vector machines, random
forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN,
• designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and
scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
Iris Dataset
An example
Import the relevant libraries and create a DataFrame containing the sample
dataset (which comes built‐in to scikit‐learn)
![[iris-dataset.png]]
But first, some data exploration
Let’s break it down: Load Iris dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris= load_iris()

Now we have loaded iris dataset let’s print its features/input and
target/output
```python 
# Store features matrix in X
X= iris.data
#Store target (labels) vector in
y= iris.target
# Names of features/columns in iris dataset
print(iris.feature_names)

# Output : ['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)’]
# we have 4 features in the iris dataset named Sepal, Petal, length, and width

# Names of target/output in iris dataset
print(iris.target_names)
Output : ['setosa' 'versicolor' 'virginica']

# size of feature matrix
print(iris.data.shape)
Output: (150, 4)
#we have total of 150 rows/samples/observations/records/instances and 4 features/columns

# size of target vector
print(iris.target.shape)
# Output : (150,)
# Iris target stores 150 samples of iris species

#how is it stored?
# Feature Data
#let's print features
print(iris.data)
Output
[[5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2]
[4.9 3. 1.4 0.2]
[4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2]
[4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2]
[5. 3.6 1.4 0.2] ...}
#5.1 is sepal length (cm), 3.5 is sepal width (cm), … etc

# Target Data
# print target vector iris species: 0 = setosa, 1 = versicolor, 2 = virginica
# print(iris.target)
#Output :
# [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
# 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2
# 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2]

#This built-in iris dataset is stored as a NumPy array so first let’s convert it into a data frame using pandas
#Converting into Dataframe
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.DataFrame(data= np.c_[iris['data'], iris['target']],
columns= iris['feature_names'] + ['Species'])

#Get Distribution of Iris species in the target variable
df['Species'].value_counts()
Output :
2.0 50
1.0 50
0.0 50
Name: Species, dtype: int64
# Here we can see the distribution of each Iris species is equal (50 samples for each class
# where the total of 3 classes is 150 samples

#Describe function
# Using the describe function give us statistical information about our dataset
df.describe()
```

Central tendency tells you about the centers of the data. Useful measures include the mean
(sum of all values divided by the number of values), median (middle value when all numbers
are arranged in order), and mode (most frequent value).
Variability tells you about the spread of the data. Useful measures include variance (how far each value in
the dataset is from the mean, on average) and standard deviation (the square root of the variance).
Standard Deviation of the Values
Pie Charts
One of the clearest ways to present data:
• making sense of the numbers requires cognitive effort and attention.
• on the other hand, we make immediate sense of pie charts with less mental
effort.
• conveys information in a way that the human brain will understand and care
about.
• Where to use?
• doing exploratory analysis of a dataset (How many of our customers are senior
citizens? How many of the page views came from Leeds?)
• communicating the results of a classifier.

#### Pie chart
```python
#Generating a basic pie chart :
#calling the plot() method on a Pandas Series object whose index gives us the flower species
sums_by_species = df.groupby('species').sum()
var = 'sepal width (cm) '
sums_by_species [var]. plot (kind= 'pie', fontsize=20) plt.ylabel(var, horizontal alignment='left') plt.title('Breakdown for ' + var, fontsize=25) plt.savefig('iris_pie_for_one_variable.jpg')
plt.close()

#calling plot() on a DataFrame with multiple columns, we can generate a different chart for each column all in the same figure
sums_by_species = df.groupby('species').sum () sums_by_species.plot(kind='pie', subplots=True layout= (2, 2),legend=False)
plt.title('Total Measurements, by Species') plt.savefig('iris_pie_for_each_variable.jpg')
plt.close()
```
When to use:
What data types is it for:
Example:
#### Bar chart
```python
#Generating a basic bar chart:
#relative sizes of the different flowers
sums_by_species = df.groupby('species').sum() 
var = 'sepal width (cm)'
sums_by_species [var].plot (kind='bar', fontsize=15, rot=30)

plt.title('Breakdown for' + var , fontsize=20) plt.savefig('iris_bar_for_one_variable.jpg')
plt.close()

sums_by_species = df.groupby('species').sum() 
sums_by_species.plot(kind='bar', subplots=True, fontsize=12)

plt.suptitle('Total Measurements, by Species')
plt.savefig('iris_bar_for_each_variable.jpg')
plt.close()
```
When to use:
What data types is it for:
Example:
#### Historgram
a sense of whether there are a few distinct outliers
• how much variation is in the population etc.
```python
#Generating histograms for all the columns and put them together in one figure :
df.plot(kind='hist', subplots=True, layout = (2,2) plt.suptitle('Iris Histograms', fontsize=20)
plt.show()

#plotting each species separately, but on the same axes and
in different colors:
```
