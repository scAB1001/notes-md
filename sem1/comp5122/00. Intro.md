What is Data Science?
- The purpose of computing
is insight, not numbers.
- – Richard W. Hamming

Kenneth Neil Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger wrote an article
called “The Rise of Big Data”. In it, they discuss the concept of
datafication
- They define datafication as a process of “taking all aspects of life
and turning them into data.”
- Example: How we quantify “health and wellbeing” using a
smartwatch
- Take someone who wears a fitness tracker. Without really thinking
about it, parts of their daily life such as sleep, steps, heart rate, and
movement are turned into data they can see.
- Over time, that data helps them notice things they would’ve missed:
- Keep feeling tired in the mornings even when they thought they had
slept enough.
- When they check their sleep data, they notice they were waking up
several times a night without realising. That helped them connect
the problem to late-night screen time and caffeine.
- Their watch also tracks their resting heart rate.
- One month, they saw it slowly creeping up. They hadn’t noticed any
changes in how they felt, but that little number made them pay
attention. They realised they had been working longer hours and
skipping their evening walks.
- Once we datafy things, we can transform their purpose and turn the
information into new forms of value.
- The app shows gentle reminders and weekly trends. When they sit
for too long, it nudges them to move.
- When they go to their GP about feeling low-energy and stressed,
they didn’t just have to describe things vaguely. They could show
the doctor their sleep patterns and heart-rate trends over a few
months. That helped the doctor give more tailored advice, instead
of guessing.
Data keeps growing with no signs of slowing
Profile of a Data Scientist
• Computer science
• Math
• Statistics
• Machine learning
• Domain expertise
• Communication and presentation skills
• Data visualization
Example1: The Internet Movie Database (IMDb)
• Crowdsourced and curated data about all aspects of the motion picture
industry, at www.imdb.com
• Data on over 3.3 million movies and TV programs
For each film, IMDb includes:
• its title, running time, genres, date of release, and a full list of cast and crew.
• financial data about each production, including the budget for making the film and
how well it did at the box office.
• ratings for each film from viewers and critics (scores on a zero to ten stars scale)
• written reviews
• links between films: for example, identifying which other films have been watched
most often by viewers of a film
What kind of questions can you answer with this data?
• Which actors appeared in the most films? Appeared in the lowest
rated films? Had the longest career or the shortest lifespan?
• What was the highest rated film each year, or the best in each
genre? Which movies lost the most money, had the highest-powered
casts, or got the least favorable reviews.
• How well does movie gross correlate with viewer ratings or awards?
• How do Hollywood movies compare to Korean movies, in terms of
ratings, budget, and gross? Are foreign movies better received than
American films, and how does this differ between U.S. and non-U.S.
reviewers?
• What is the age distribution of actors and actresses in films?
• How much younger is the actress playing the wife, on average,
than the actor playing the husband?
• Has this disparity been increasing or decreasing with time?
• In which movies did Tom Hanks played with Keanu Reeves?

Example2: Gapminder Wealth and Health of Nations
GDP per capita (Gross Domestic Product per person), which reflects a
country’s total economic output divided by its population.
• An indicator of a nation’s wealth
• Useful for cross-country comparisons of economic resources and their
effects on outcomes like life expectancy

Objectives
The heart of data science lies in doing the simple things right:
understanding the application domain, cleaning and integrating
relevant data sources, and presenting your results clearly to others.
• It takes considerable insight and experience to ask the right
questions, and sense whether you are moving toward correct
answers and actionable insights.
