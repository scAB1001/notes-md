9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
### Principal Components
Principal Component
When performing SVD, we’ve left the columns in the “data” matrix UΣ unnamed.
● Their common name: “Principal Components”\*.
● Example: The second column of UΣ is the “2nd principal component” of our
original matrix.

*: There’s an important technical detail we’ll need to fix first*
#### Interpreting Principal Components
Let’s look at a geometric interpretation of:
● principal components.
● The rank-k approximation as a whole.
This is easiest if we work with a simple dataset with 2 attributes
We’ll use the dataset below showing
the age 5 mortality rates and fertility rates
for most of the countries around the world.

Data, Rank 2, and Rank 1 Approximation
Below, we see the original data, along with the rank 2 and rank 1
approximations.
● As before, we see that approximation at rank 1 is still fairly decent.
● The degree to which it is decent depends on how strong the relationship is
between mortality and fertility.
● We can get a lot more insight by looking at things visually.

The Rank 1 Approximation Visually
We see that the rank 1 approximation projects the data on to a 1D subspace.
![[mortality-fertility-vis-rank-1.png]]
There’s a significant issue with our rank 1 approximation. What is it?
Our approximation goes through the origin, but original data has non-zero y-
intercept.
For other datasets, the impact of this y-intercept mismatch can be severe.
Typically, to deal with this issue we recenter the data by subtracting the mean
of each column for all values in that column. Resulting projection is much
better
Data Uncentering
After performing the approximation, you can add back the means to get back to
the original x and y scale

Intuitive Picture of Low Rank Approximation
Consider the maternal fertility vs. child
mortality data we discussed earlier.
Technically, every country has its own
separate fertility and mortality.
![[mortality-fertility-vis-pc.png]]
● Looking at the plot, we see that we can
approximate by saying that each
country lies on a continuum between
“bottom left” and “top right”.
In essence, the 1st principal component
gives each country a single score along this
intuitive axis!
Given U, Σ, and VT below, write an expression to
compute PC1 for Afghanistan.
● Hint the first column of UΣ is the 1st PC (for all
countries).
Since the principal components are just the columns of
UΣ, we just compute the top left entry of UΣ:
● -0.0954 * 43.48 + 0.023 * 0 = -4.15
![[mortality-fertility-vis-pc-table.png]]
Naturally, we can plot countries vs. PC1.
● Only one dimension so we end up with
a rug plot.
PC1 Back to 2D
Our rank 1 approximation is essentially just
going from PC1 back into 2 dimensions.
Give expressions that compute the rank 1
approximation for the fertility and mortality
rates for Afghanistan
To get our rank 1 estimates for Afghanistan:
● Recall our original data X = UΣVT.
● So just multiply the first value of the
column (principal component) of UΣ by
the first row of VT.
● Mortality: -4.14 \* -0.929 = 3.86
● Fertility: -4.14 \*-0.368 = 1.53

The first principal component captures
much of the variance, but not all.
● Differently worded: Countries live near
the line, but not exactly on it.
By using 2nd principal component, we can
get back original data exactly.

PC2
Low PC2 countries
High PC2 countries
PC2 is harder to interpret.
● It tells you how much you lie “above”
or “below” the PC1 line.
The gray area shows countries with similar
values of PC1.
● Countries at the top left of the oval
have “large” PC2.
● Countries at the bottom left have
“small” PC2

### Low Rank Approximation vs. Regression
To get a deeper understanding of what’s going on, let’s see a comparison to
linear regression which you saw in Data 8.
Let’s start with a very quick review of linear regression.
● This will be purely conceptual glance.
Regression: The Big Idea
Suppose we know the child mortality rate
of a given country.
● Linear regression tries to predict the
fertility rate from the mortality rate.
● For example, if the mortality is 6, we
might guess the fertility is near
The regression line tells us the “best”
prediction of fertility given all possible
mortality values
● Minimizes the root mean squared
error [see vertical red lines, only some
shown].

We can also perform a regression in the
reverse direction.
That is, given the fertility, we try to predict
the mortality.
In this case, we get a different regression
line which minimizes the root mean
squared length of the horizontal lines.
