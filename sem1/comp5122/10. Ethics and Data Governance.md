# 10. ETHICS AND DATA GOVERNANCE 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND
To develop your understanding of:
•Why data analytics raises ethical issues (lecture 1)
•Data governance and the legal situation (lecture 2)
•Regulations and data, and the reasons for these
•The relationship between ethical issues and the laws
•Key ethical issues or risks in data science, processing, analysis
•Issues of data quality, bias, privacy, anonymisation
•Ethical issues in the use of data analysis
•Whether responsibility can go ‘backwards’
•“I just generate the knowledge, what others do with it us up to them”
•Depending on time: Q&A
Point of the lectures:
•To help with assessment (clear an immediate obstacle).
• Providing you with guidance to help complete the assessment
•To help your employability (clear future obstacles).
• Reflecting on your role in society as a data scientist; how you ‘add value’ with specialist
skills
• How these determine your wider responsibilities to employers/customers/society
• Employers will like this
•To hopefully offer interesting ideas for reflecting on your studies/practice
## 1. What is Ethics
Learning objectives:
•To gain a general understanding of the purpose of ethical thinking
•Begin to identify why data analytics is a practice that raises ethical
issues

WHAT IS ETHICS?
•As a starting point: ethics is a way of deciding what we should (and should not) do
•Evaluating our actions and choices
•Assessing ethical judgements
•Interrogating the reasoning behind those judgements
•Two goals:
1. Figure out what the right thing to do is (or, what is ok/permissible to do)
2. Figure out why it is right (or ok/permissible)
Hopefully… leading to us act accordingly (following through on that)

Trolley problem example
Seems like we have the following intuition:
-It’s better to pull the lever
Reasoning helps clarify why that seems the best
action:
-It’s morally better to save more lives than fewer
This seems like a good reason (hard to dispute)
When our intuitions and reasons are ‘in sync’:
no problem – what we sense is right also seems
most reasonable / rational to do
So might as well do it

HOW TO CAST DOUBT
Intuition:
-It’s better to pull the lever
Reasoning:
-It’s morally better to save more lives than fewer
Doubt method 1: Critique
the action. Highlight
reasons against
Doubt method 2:
Critique the
reason. Highlight
the problem
implications

What
Why
Q: Are these
reasons
enough to
sway our
intuitions?
Pull the leverDon’t pull the lever
Causing the death
of someone, killing them
Not up to us to intervene
More lives saved =
morally better
Different
reasoning
justifies
different
courses of
action
Doubt method 1: what about
the reasons against?

EXAMPLE 2: FAT
MAN BRIDGE What should you do
A: Push the fat man (kill 1)
B: Don’t push the fat man
(allow 5 to die)
C: Not sure (also allow 5 to
die)
18
EXAMPLE 2: FAT
MAN BRIDGE Push the fat man:
More lives saved = morally better
Don’t push the fat man:
We would be causing the death
of someone, killing them
Not up to us to intervene
19
From a 2006 BBC
Survey:
Push fat man:
26.88%
Don’t:
73.12%
Cross-culturally
consistent
INTUITIO
NS AND
REASONS
Most people have the following intuition:
-It’s better to not push the fat man
Justified by:
-It’s not our place to intervene / cause his death
But in the ‘split tracks’ case we thought that:
-It’s morally better to save more lives than fewer
Was the reason we should intervene (/ kill 1 to
save 5)
What’s going on? Are (most of us) inconsistent,
and therefore irrational?
20
Q: Should we act
against our
intuitions in the
‘split track’ case? Or
in the ‘fat man
bridge’ case?
What
Why
Pull the lever
More lives saved =
morally better
Push the fat man
Puzzle: conflict in intuitions and
reasons Context A: Split tracks Context B: Fat man over bridge
Puzzle: the same reason justifies opposed actions, depending
on contexts
So, why not push the fat man?
If saving lives is not most important…then why pull the lever?
If you are really acting on the
basis of this reason when
pulling the lever:
To be rational, you either:
1. Should push the fat man
2. Interrogate your reasoning
further (this is not enough to
justify pulling it)

Solution 1: Act against
intuitions
Context A Context B
Benefit: Consistency. You’re acting for the reason you judge
most justified, so are in one sense acting rationally
Problem 1: You’re doing things against your moral conscience
Problem 2: Debatable you’re really acting rationally, if you see
that your reasons also justify actions that are obviously wrong

Solution 2: Interrogate our
reasons
More lives saved =
morally better
Benefits of this approach:
- Do not act against our intuitions
(/conscience)
- We learn more about our ethical
processing
- Refine our ‘system’ of ethical
principles
Consider:
What does this capture that
seemed reasonable?
What does it need qualifying
with?
Does it need adding to?
Do not expose
others to harm\*
UNLESS
\*the man on the track is already in some way in harm’s way,
whereas the fat man is a bystander, out of harms way
This
approach is
essentially
what doing
Ethics is
End goal: arrive at a
reliable set of principles, to
guide us where when
intuitions are murky
Similar to refining a
decision-making algorithm

This
approach is
essentially
what doing
Ethics is

### NAVIGATING MURKY ETHICAL ISSUES
Eventually: can reach
judgements on issues
where our intuitions are
murky

More lives saved =
morally better What does this capture that
seemed reasonable?
What does it need qualifying
with?
Does it need adding to?
Do not expose
others to harm/
violate their rights
UNLESS
UNLESS
Do not prolong
unnecessary
suffering
Eventually: can reach
judgements on issues
where our intuitions are
murky
AND/OR Respect others’
autonomous
decisions

### OVERVIEW OF ETHICS
•Basically: ethics is a way of looking at what we should and should not do
•Evaluating and assessing our actions, choices, for how they impact others
•Trying to reach consistency, sound principles for action
•Considers how to uphold people’s moral rights (distinct from legal)
•And their wellbeing (welfare, happiness, quality of life)
•Making sure we have good reasons to justify actions, where either of these are at issue
### ETHICAL CONCEPTS
Thinking through the ethical reasons behind our actions gives rise to
ethical concepts
•fairness (not taking advantage of/hoarding resources for yourself over
others)
•responsibility (living up to an entrusted role, recognising the impacts
your actions can have)
•duty (owing an action to others, based on contract/promise)
•harm / welfare (e.g. whether causing suffering to others)
•Rights (can restrict / require actions from others)
### TECHNOLOGY AND ETHICS
•Warren and Brandeis (1890) – Harvard law
professors made the case for new ‘right to
be let alone’, because of advances in the
printing press (sharing of information), and
photography
•At the time, photographs were slow – they
required someone to sit stock still in very
specific conditions, facing the photographer
(the camera being difficult to set up)

•Previously: unless you agree / are on board with the photo being taken, it’s very
easy to prevent it happening – you just move away
•‘Hit and run’ photographs now possible - taken without your knowledge or
consent, put to any use the photographer sees fit
•Depending on where they found you, could be embarrassing, even dangerous,
for you
Key Point:
Technological progress can impact people’s rights and wellbeing
So technology becomes an ethical issue: need ethical reasoning to navigate
### DATA AND ETHICS
•Being a data scientist, you are in the role of someone who can ‘extract
useful knowledge from data’ (Provost and Fawcett, p.2)
•Exhuming buried/hidden information, patterns, relationships between
variables in data sets
•These might be about particular people (indirectly), categories of people
•So you’re dealing with the knowledge of others
• Key point: with knowledge about others comes the power to affect
them
•New information be used to trace back to those individual people
•An early example of harm resulting from primitive use of datasets:
•Actress Rebecca Schaeffer, murdered by a fan stalker in 1989, Los
Angeles
•Murderer found her home address through motor vehicle licence
records
•Led to a change in the law
•Key point: unpredictable what others can do on the basis of information,
what they can cross reference it with
•Hindsight is a great teacher HTTPS://EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG/WIKI/REBECCA_SCHAEFFER

•Sets of information about individual
people
•Could be used to trace back to those
individual people
•Could fall into the hands of certain
groups who want to oppress people /
categories of people
HTTPS://PRIVACYINAFRICA.COM/2017/09/06/AFRICAN-GOVERNMENTS-ARE-REQUESTING-MORE-
USER-DATA-FROM-FACEBOOK-GOOGLE-AND-TWITTER-THAN-EVER-BEFORE/
•So much information about all of us now generated. Stored on servers, in
the cloud
•Increasing exponentially; ‘internet of things’
•Is useful: better goods and services, we can generate new knowledge about
people’s behaviour
•Gives data scientists more raw material to analyse, increasing our
knowledge, increasing effectiveness of e.g. business, govt, accuracy of
research
•Also exponentially increasing the ethical risks, unpredictability of potential
harm
What are some of the ethical issues raised by data?
### ASSORTED ISSUES
Usage of data science issues (responsible usage)
Bias baked into toolsBias in interpretations Black box/opacity Control
“Harm to subjects” issues (’caught in the dredging net’)
Privacy Consent Breaches / lax handling
Externalities (what might be on the horizon)
Shaping preferences Sustainability Interpersonal relations Automation and work
## 2. DATA ETHICS AND THE LAW (/REGULATION)
Learning objectives:
•To understand…
•The relationship between ethics and the law (/regulations)
•Key roles in data governance (Data Processor, Controller, Subject)
•Principles of UK-GDPR (2020), DPA (2018)
•Definitions of Personal Data, Special Personal Data

Ethics and law ‘come apart’. Not the same thing
• Some legal obligations are not ethical obligations, eg. exact tax
regime, side of the road to drive on.
• The law is incomplete: not everything unethical should be illegal
(e.g. lying to a friend)
•It is difficult to ‘keep up’ with rapidly advancing technology. Laws
are updated through us realizing different things are right/wrong.
Can’t just look to the law to see what you should do:
•Laws contain ethical concepts: need interpreting via ethical
reasoning

UK-GDPR
Principles:
1. Personal data (PD) must be
processed fairly, lawfully and
transparently
2. Only collected/processed for
explicit and legitimate
purpose(s)
Fairly and
transparently
Legitimate purposes
“conduct that falls short of the
standards expected of a person
where a duty of care is owed and
which causes foreseeable damage
to another person.” Peter De Cruz,
Nutshells Medical Law.
Negligence = Falls short of
standards expected
Duty of care

‘Just following the law’ is
not a sensible policy:
- Some legal acts are still
unethical
- Sometimes laws are
unethical/incomplete/ne
ed updating
- To be able to follow laws
requires you think about
the ethics of situations
### ETHICS AND LAW
The function of ethics:
Determine what we should do, what moral (not legal) rights we have
Based on how our actions impact others’ moral rights and wellbeing
The function of law (ideally):
Provide guide rails to restrict behavior that could lead to harm
Clarify consequences of that behavior / contain the ‘fallout’ from it (no vengeance spirals)
Protect rights of individuals from powerful others (/the state)
Reassure citizens about participating in a society, accessing goods/services
Implement society’s ethical viewpoint, updated based on results of ethical reasoning
### DATA PROTECTION AND THE LAW
To track you/access your identity, what sources of data could someone
look at? •Search histories
•Automatic Number Plate Recognition
•CCTV
•Medical records
•RFID – in shops / cashpoints etc
•WiFi / Bluetooth / mobile towers
•Google and Apple location histori
With everyone leaving an extensive digital ‘exhaust trail’, this leaves
people open to harm and exploitation
•Data science: ‘extract[ing] useful knowledge from data’ (Provost and
Fawcett, p.2)
•Maybe about / or relating to people
Potentially harmful consequences for individuals and groups
#### A HISTORICAL EXAMPLE
•From primitive datasets:
•Actress Rebecca Schaeffer, murdered by a fan stalker in 1989, Los
Angeles
•Murderer hired PI who found her home address through vehicle licence
database
•Led to a change in US law (Driver’s Privacy Protection Act), preventing
such releases
•Key point: unpredictable what others will want to do with data
•and how they will ‘link’ information known with new information
#### CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLE
•Sets of information about individual
people
•Could be used to trace back to those
individual people
•Could fall into the hands of certain
groups who want to oppress people /
categories of people
#### MODERN data
Modern times, we have exponentially increased:
Ease of collection / generation (many more devices spilling out data)
Ease of storage (greater hard drive space, cloud storage)
Sophistication of processing (faster processors, ability to find out new information from
datasets)
Leading to…
Unforeseen uses (as we can learn more from data, the more we can use it for, for good or
bad)
The law’s functions (see earlier slide) seem to be needed
### Now, in the UK
UK DPA (2018) UK-GDPR (2020) is
based on the EU GDPR (2018)
Can’t give a thorough breakdown
of it, but there is an emphasis on:
Data controllers and data
processors need to respect
privacy and seek consent from
data subjects
…not assume consent.
Data subjects have more power:
e.g. the right to be forgotten

### SOME KEY DEFINITIONS
Data Controller: determines the purposes
and means of processing personal data
Data Processor: responsible for processing
personal data on behalf of a controller
Data Subject: an individual who is the
subject of personal data
Information Commissioner: The person or
group who is responsible for enforcing
the GDPR/DPA. In the UK that is ICO
(Information Commissioner's Office)
These two definitions are
distinguished so that the
right moral and legal
responsibilities can be
allocated. However, they
are not mutually exclusive.
That is, it is possible to be
both.
#### Examples
Definitions:
Data Controller: A person
who determines the
purposes for which and
the manner in which any
personal data are, or are
to be, processed.
Data Processor: Any person
(other than an employee
of the data controller) who
processes the data on
behalf of the data
controller.
Example 1: A government
department sets up a database
of information about every
child in the country. It does this
in partnership with local
councils. Each council provides
personal data about children in
its area, and is responsible for
the accuracy of that data. Each
council may access the data of
the other councils (and must
abide by data protection
principles).
Example 2: Organisation O
outsources its employee
payroll to company A. O also
engages a marketing
company B to do a
satisfaction survey of its
customers. Company A will
need information about O’s
employees. Company B will
need information about O’s
customers. Company A and
B have their own employees
Q: IN THESE EXAMPLES, WHO
IS THE CONTROLLER AND WHO
THE PROCESSOR?
Answers:
E1: Government department and the
councils are data controllers, in relation
to the personal data on the database.
E2: Both A & B will be processing
information on behalf of O, so they are
both data processors, while O is the data
controller. A & B also process personal
data about their own employees and will
also be the data controllers for that.
### DATA GOVERNANCE
Data governance concerns to the collection, availability,
usability, integrity and security of how data is managed in
a given enterprise.
What is data governance?
The control of data collection, processing and use
How does it work?
Through sets of processes that ensure certain standards
are maintained
What are the standards?
To uphold security and integrity
Why bother?
Protects both the data, and the well-being of the people
the data relates to
Data governance ties together
all other aspects of data
management – it is the core
component
### TYPES OF DATA ON GDPR UK-GDPR:
“Personal data”: relates to a person
“Special category data”: ‘sensitive’ data relating
to a person
Processing special category data requires you
offer extra legal justification / reason for doing
so
#### PERSONAL DATA
Definitions:
Personal data is data which
relates to a living individual who
can be identified:
a) From that data or
b) From that data and other
information which is in the
possession of, or is likely to
come into the possession
of, the data controller.
Example 3: An organisation
holds data on microfiche. The
microfiche records do not
identify individuals by name,
but bear unique reference
numbers which can be matched
to a card index system to
identify the individual
concerned. Does this count as
personal data?
Example 4: A dataset involves
the exact addresses and the
prices of every house that was
sold in Leeds in the year 2005.
Does this count as personal
data?
Q: LOOK AT THESE EXAMPLES.
ARE THEY INSTANCES OF
“PERSONAL DATA”?Answers:
E3: Yes – it can be
linked
E4: It could be (see
the notes below)
### SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA
The UK GDPR defines special category data as:
•personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;
•personal data revealing political opinions;
•personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;
•personal data revealing trade union membership;
•genetic data;
•biometric data (where used for identification purposes);
•data concerning health;
•data concerning a person’s sex life; and
•data concerning a person’s sexual orientation.
This does not include personal data about criminal allegations, proceedings or convictions, as separate
rules apply. For further information, please see our separate guidance on criminal offence data.
Q: WHY ARE THESE TYPES
OF PERSONAL DATA
TREATED MORE
SERIOUSLY BY THE LAW?
### GDPR: SEVEN PRINCIPLES
All data controllers/processors must follow the seven
principles of the GDPR, concerning how to collect,
process and store personal data:
1. Must be done lawfully, fairly and transparently
2. For explicit and legitimate purpose(s)
3. Limited to the purpose(s) (data minimization)
4. Accurate and up to date
5. Storage limitation (not stored for longer than
need for purpose(s))
6. Integrity and confidential (security)
7. Controller shows accountability
Research Exemption:
In certain cases, when it will
not cause harm to subjects,
data may be kept
indefinitely for research
purposes. The research
purposes cannot go against
the stated purpose for the
collection of the data, and
any publication of the
research must be sure to
adequately anonymise the
data.
