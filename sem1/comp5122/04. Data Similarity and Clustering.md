Data Similarity
• Once an object can be represented as data, we can measure the similarity between
objects, or alternatively the distance between objects.
• Let’s consider we represent each object as a feature vector. Then, the closer two
objects are in the space defined by the features, the more similar they are.
• • Amazon, Netflix, Spotify use similarity to provide recommendations
“People who like X also like Y”

### k-Means Clustering
• k-means clustering is one of the simplest and most commonly used clustering
algorithms.
• It tries to find cluster centers that are representative of certain regions of the data.
• The algorithm alternates between two steps: assigning each data point to the closest
cluster center, and then setting each cluster center as the mean of the data points that
are assigned to it.
• The algorithm is finished when the assignment of instances to clusters no longer
changes.
