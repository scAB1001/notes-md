What is Data Mining?
• Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of
uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets.

What is Artificial intelligence?
• The term Artificial Intelligence, as a research field, was coined at the conference on
the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956, even though the idea was
around since antiquity.
• For instance, in the first manifesto of Artificial Intelligence, “Intelligent Machinery”, in
1948 Alan Turing distinguished two different approaches to AI, which may be termed
"top-down“ or knowledge-driven AI and "bottom-up“ or data-driven AI

What is Artificial intelligence?
• The two different approaches to AI can be detailed:
– "top-down“ or knowledge-driven AI
• cognition = high-level phenomenon, independent of low-level details of implementation
mechanism, first neuron (1943), first neural network machine (1950), neucognitron (1975)
• Evolutionary Algorithms (1954,1957, 1960), Reasoning (1959,1970), Expert Systems (1970),
Logic, Intelligent Agent Systems (1990)…
– "bottom-up“ or data-driven AI
• opposite approach, start from data to build incrementally and mathematically mechanisms
taking decisions
• Machine learning algorithms, Decision Trees (1983), Backpropagation (1984-1986), Random
Forest (1995), Support Vector Machine (1995), Boosting (1995), Deep Learning (1998/2006)…

• AI is originally defined, by Marvin Lee Minsky, as “the construction of computer
programs doing tasks, that are, for the moment, accomplished more satisfyingly by
human beings because they require high level mental processes such as: learning.
perceptual organization of memory and critical reasoning”.
• There are so the "artificial" side with the usage of computers or sophisticated
electronic processes and the side “intelligence” associated with its goal to imitate
the (human) behavior

Why Learn?
• Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion
using example data or past experience.
• There is no need to “learn” to calculate payroll
• Learning is used when:
• Human expertise does not exist (navigating on Mars),
• Humans are unable to explain their expertise (speech recognition)
• Solution changes in time (routing on a computer network)
• Solution needs to be adapted to particular cases (user biometrics)

What do we mean by Learning?
• Learning general models from a data of particular examples
• Data is cheap and abundant (data warehouses, data marts); knowledge is
expensive and scarce.
• Example in retail: Customer transactions to consumer behavior:
• People who bought “Da Vinci Code” also bought “The Five People You Meet in
Heaven” (www.amazon.com)
• Build a model that is a good and useful approximation to the data.
• Retail: Market basket analysis, Customer relationship management (CRM)
• Finance: Credit scoring, fraud detection
• Manufacturing: Optimization, troubleshooting
• Medicine: Medical diagnosis
• Telecommunications: Quality of service optimization
• Bioinformatics: Motifs, alignment
• Web mining: Search engines

What is Machine Learning?
• Optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience.
• Role of Statistics: Inference from a sample
• Role of Computer science: Efficient algorithms to
• Solve the optimization problem
• Representing and evaluating the model for inference

Data Mining vs Machine Learning
• Data mining looks for patterns that already exist in the data, while machine
learning learns from past data to predict future outcomes.

*Labelled vs Unlabelled pathway*
ML focuses on the development of algorithms that learn from data, building models to predict, classify, cluster or perform tasks.
## Labelled Data: Supervised Learning
Goal is to create a function that maps
inputs to outputs.
● Model is learned from example
input/output pairs. Each pair consists of:
○ Input vector.
○ Output value (label).
● Regression: Output value is quantitative.
● Classification: Output value is
categorical.

• Supervised machine learning is one of the most commonly used and successful
types of machine learning.
• Supervised learning is used whenever we want to predict a certain outcome from a
given input
• We have examples of input/output pairs
• We build a machine learning model from these input/output pairs -> training
set
• Our goal is to make accurate predictions for new, never-before-seen data
### Classification and Regression
• There are two major types of supervised machine learning problems, called
classification and regression.
• In classification, the goal is to predict a class label, which is a choice from a
predefined list of possibilities.
• Binary classification
• Classifying emails as either spam or not spam.
• “Is this email spam?”: yes/no, positive/negative
• Multiclass classification
• Predicting what language a website is in: pre-defined list of possible
languages
### Classification
• Example: Credit scoring
• Differentiating between low-
risk and high-risk customers
from their income and
savings
(sources: Ethem Alpaydın)
Discriminant: IF income > θ1 AND savings > θ2
THEN low-risk ELSE high-risk
![[classification-ex 1.png]]
• Also known as Pattern recognition
• Face recognition: Pose, lighting, occlusion (glasses, beard), make-up, hair style
• Character recognition: Different handwriting styles.
• Speech recognition: Temporal dependency.
• Use of a dictionary or the syntax of the language.
• Sensor fusion: Combine multiple modalities; eg, visual (lip image) and acoustic for
speech
• Medical diagnosis: From symptoms to illnesses
E.g. Training examples of a person
### Regression: Applications
• Navigating a car: Angle of the steering wheel (CMU NavLab)
• Kinematics of a robot arm

## Unlabelled Data: Unsupervised Learning
In “Unsupervised Learning”:
● Goal is to identify patterns in
unlabeled data.
○ We do not have input/output pairs.
○ Note: Sometimes we may have
labels, but we’re just choosing to
ignore them (e.g. PCA on labeled
data).
Dimensionality Reduction.
● Solution: PCA.

• Unsupervised learning includes all kinds of machine learning where there is no
known output, no teacher to instruct the learning algorithm. -> no supervision
• In unsupervised learning, the learning algorithm is just shown the input data and
asked to extract knowledge from this data.
### Dimensionality Reduction: Transformations of the dataset
• Unsupervised transformations of a dataset are algorithms that create a new
representation of the data which might be easier for humans or other machine learning
algorithms to understand compared to the original representation of the data.
For example,
Dimensionality Reduction takes a high-dimensional representation of the data,
consisting of many features, and finds a new way to represent this data that
summarizes the essential characteristics with
fewer features.
• Dimensionality reduction to two dimensions for visualization purposes
• Topic extraction on collections of text documents
### Clustering
• Clustering algorithms, on the other hand, partition data into distinct groups of similar
items.
• The goal is to split up the data in such a way that points within a single cluster are very
similar and points in different clusters are different.
• Similarly to classification algorithms, clustering algorithms assign (or predict) a cluster
to a particular data point.
For example: Organizing uploaded pictures, group together pictures that show the same
person or location.

• Learning “what normally happens”
• No output
• Clustering: Grouping similar instances
• Example applications
• Customer segmentation in CRM
• Image compression: Color quantization
• Bioinformatics: Learning motifs

Clustering: Partition a dataset into groups based on the similarity between the instances

### Reinforcement Learning
• Learning a policy: A sequence of outputs
• No supervised output but delayed reward
• Credit assignment problem
• Game playing
• Robot in a maze
• Multiple agents, partial observability, ...
