### Recommender Systems
Main types of recommender algorithms
- Collaborative or social recommenders
	- Suggestion lists, “top-n” offers and promotions
- Content-based recommenders
	- E-mail filters, clipping services
- Knowledge-based recommenders
	- Buying guides for cars, or houses
- Hybrid recommenders
	- Combination of any of the above
### User-user Collaborative Filtering (CF)
- Recommends items to the user based on what other similar users have liked (e.g. people like you prefer this, you may like it as well)
- How to find other user’s preferences?
- Explicit methods (ratings –MovieLens/Netflix, Amazon)
- Implicit methods (observations – what they buy, what they visit – less reliable)

- Other’s ratings
-  What others like
- My ratings
-  What I like
Give me what people similar to me would like … “Word of mouth” “Voting”
#### Step 1: Input data for the example
![[collaborative-filtering-getting-matrix-background-data-ex.png]]
*Example of building data vector*

1-5 is dislikes-like, 0 is we don't know as they haven't interacted with the system.
#### Step 2: Find nearest neighbours
##### 2.1. Find similarity with each person
Sometimes referred to as “K-nearest neighbour user-user collaborative filtering”

u3 = {5,1,?,4,5,0,5}
u1 = 

cosine similarity
sin(v_3, v_?) = u1 \cdot u3
() / divide that by the norm abs(root(each item^2 + eachother)) x norm of second vector

##### 2.2. Define neighbourhood
Centre-based neighbourhood (size n)
- sort and take first n (the higher the number, the closer the two users are)
##### Step 3: Predictions/recommendations
Weighted sum
- scans the neighbourhood and calculates the frequency for each item
- can be combined with the rating value

Weighted sum: (0x0.63+2x0.71+4x0.93) / (0.63+0.71+0.93) = 2.26

Association rules recommendation
- expands the number of items based on association rules upon what has been recommended by the neighbours
##### Pros and Cons of user-user CF
Advantages:
-  taps into social interaction data
-  can recommend items that are not linked to the user’s earlier choices (useful for promotions)
-  considers the opinions of a wide spectrum of users
-  popular in social media applications; broader applications
Disadvantages:
- 
##### Compare the results: 2.62 vs 4.62
- Explain why there is a difference in the predicted values.
- Which result, User-User or Item-Item, would you trust more? Why?
- We need a mechanism to evaluate the recommender algorithms.
How can we do this?
= evaluate an Information Retrieval algorithm? (we’ll return to this in the topic on evaluation)
#### Scalability Problem
- Can you identify cases when the user-user and item-item CF algorithms will not scale?
- Clue: what is the most computationally expensive part of these algorithms?
Amazon’s collaborative filtering algorithm is a way to address the scalability problem.

### Item-item Collaborative Filtering (CF)
 Same setup and matrix but for items not users (item_3 not u_3)
