#### Module Objectives
Three types of distributed systems
1. High performance distributed computing systems
2. Distributed information systems
3. Distributed systems for pervasive computing
### High Performance Distributed Computing System
High-performance distributed computing started with parallel computing
• Multiprocessor and multi-core versus multi-computer 
#### Distributed Shared Memory systems 
Observation Multiprocessors are relatively easy to program in comparison to multi-computers, yet have problems when increasing the number of processors (or cores). 

Solution: Try to implement a shared-memory model on top of a multi-computer. Example through virtual-memory techniques Map all main-memory pages (from different processors) into one single virtual address space. 

If a process at processor A addresses a page P located at processor B, the OS at A traps and fetches P from B, just as it would if P had been located on local disk. 

**Problem**
Performance of distributed shared memory could never compete with that of multiprocessors, and failed to meet the expectations of programmers. It has been widely abandoned by now.
	Roughly speaking, one can make a distinction between two subgroups of DS for high-performance computing tasks.
#### Cluster Computing
Cluster computing systems became popular when the price/performance ratio of personal computers and workstations improved. 

- It then became financially and technically attractive to build a supercomputer using off-the-shelf technology by simply hooking up a collection of relatively simple computers in a high-speed network. 
- In virtually all cases, cluster computing is used for parallel programming in which a single (compute intensive) program is run in parallel on multiple machines.
##### Linux-based Beowulf clusters
![[cluster-computing-system-ex.png]]
- Each cluster consists of a collection of compute nodes that are controlled and accessed by means of a single master node. 
- The master typically handles the allocation of nodes to a particular parallel program, maintains a batch queue of submitted jobs, and provides an interface for the users of the system. 
	- As such, the master actually runs the middleware needed for the execution of programs and management of the cluster, while the compute nodes are equipped with a standard OS extended with typical middleware functions for communication, storage, fault tolerance, and so on. 
- Apart from the master node, the compute nodes are thus seen to be highly identical.
##### MOSIX system [Amar et al., 2004] 
MOSIX takes a more symmetric approach; it attempts to provide a single-system image of a cluster, meaning that to a process a cluster computer offers the ultimate distribution transparency by appearing to be a single computer. 

As we mentioned, providing such an image under all circumstances is impossible. 
With MOSIX, the high degree of transparency is provided by allowing processes to dynamically and preemptively migrate between the nodes that make up the cluster. 

Process migration allows a user to start an application on any node (referred to as the home node), after which it can transparently move to other nodes, for example, to make efficient use of resources.

However, several modern cluster computers have been moving away from these symmetric architectures to more hybrid solutions in which the middleware is functionally partitioned across different nodes, as explained by En- gelmann et al. [2007]. 

The advantage of such a separation is obvious: 
- having compute nodes with dedicated, lightweight operating systems will most likely provide optimal performance for compute-intensive applications. 
- Likewise, storage functionality can most likely be optimally handled by other specially configured nodes such as file and directory servers. 
- The same holds for other dedicated middleware services, including job management, database services, and perhaps general Internet access to external services.

- Essentially a group of high-end systems connected
- through a Local Area Network (LAN)
- Homogeneous: same OS, near-identical hardware
- Single managing node running the OS
#### Grid Computing
Comprising DSs that are often constructed as a federation of computer systems, where each system may fall under a different administrative domain, and may be very different when it comes to hardware, software, and deployed network technology.
#### Cloud Computing
From the perspective of grid computing, a next logical step is to simply outsource the entire infrastructure that is needed for compute-intensive applications. 

In essence, this is what cloud computing is all about: 
- providing the facilities to dynamically construct an infrastructure and compose what is needed from available services. 

Unlike grid computing, which is strongly associated with high-performance computing, cloud computing is much more than just providing lots of resources.

Cloud computing is an information technology infrastructure in which computing resources are virtualised and accessed as a service.

The next step: lots of nodes from everywhere
- Flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources
- Enable communities “Virtual Organisations” to share geographically distributed resources as they pursue common goals
 
  Distinction between four layers:
1. Hardware: Processors, routers, power and cooling systems.
	Customers normally never get to see these
2. Infrastructure: Deploys virtualisation techniques. 
	Evolves around allocating and managing virtual storage devices and virtual servers
3. Platform: Provides higher-level abstractions for storage and such.
4. Application: Actual applications, such as office suites (text processors, spreadsheet applications, presentation applications). Comparable to the suite of apps shipped with OSes.
	Comparable to the suite of apps shipped with OSes.
  
### Distributed Information Systems
Context: Integrating applications
Situation: organisations confronted with many networked applications, but achieving interoperability was painful.

Basic approach: a networked application is one that runs on a server making its services available to remote clients. Simple integration: clients combine requests for (different) applications; send that off; collect responses, and present a coherent result to the user. 

Next step: allow direct application-to-application communication, leading to Enterprise Application Integration (EAI).
  
Example: Distributed Transaction Processing
Context: Database applications where operations are carried out in the form of transactions

##### Transaction

| Primitive           | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `BEGIN_TRANSACTION` | Mark the start of a transaction                 |
| `END_TRANSACTION`   | Terminate the transaction and try to commit     |
| `ABORT_TRANSACTION` | Kill the transaction and restore the old values |
| `READ`              | Read data from a file, a table, or otherwise    |
| `WRITE`             | Write data from a file, a table, or otherwise   |
##### All or Nothing Property
Atomic: happens indivisibly (seemingly)
Consistent: does not violate system in-variants
Isolated: not mutual interference between concurrent transactions
Durable: commit means changes are permanent
 
**TPM: Transaction Processing Monitor**
In many cases, the data involved in a transaction is distributed across several servers. A TP Monitor is responsible for coordinating the execution of a transaction. 
  
**Middleware and EAI**
Middleware offers communication facilities for application integration Remote Procedure Call (RPC): Requests are sent through local procedure call, packaged as message, processed, responded through message, and result returned as return from call.

Message Oriented Middleware (MOM): Messages are sent to logical contact
point (published), and forwarded to subscribed applications
 
**Distributed Pervasive Systems**
Emerging next-generation of distributed systems in which nodes are small, mobile, and often embedded in a larger system, characterised by the fact that the system naturally blends into the user's environment

- Often coined as the Internet of Things (IoT)
- Three (overlapping) sub-types:
	1. Ubiquitous computing systems: pervasive and continuously present, i.e., there is a continuous interaction between system and user.
	2. Mobile computing systems: pervasive, but emphasis is on the fact that devices are inherently mobile.
	3. Sensor (and actuator) networks: pervasive, with emphasis on the actual (collaborative) sensing and actuation of the environment.

**Mobile Computing Systems**
**Features**
- A myriad of different mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, GPS devices, remote controls)
- Mobile implies that a device's location is expected to change over time, change of local services, reachability

Keyword: **discovery**
- Communication may become more difficult: no stable route, (possibly) no guaranteed connectivity 
- disruption-tolerant networking.

**Bottom line**
Mobile devices set up connections to stationary servers, essentially bringing mobile computing in the position of clients of cloud-based services.
- Mobile cloud computing
- Mobile edge computing
