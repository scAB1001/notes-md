#### Module Objectives
Three types of distributed systems
1. High performance distributed computing systems
2. Distributed information systems
3. Distributed systems for pervasive computing

High Performance Distributed Computing System
High-performance distributed computing started with parallel computing
• Multiprocessor and multi-core versus multi-computer 

Distributed Shared Memory systems 
Observation Multiprocessors are relatively easy to program in comparison to multi-computers, yet have problems when increasing the number of processors (or cores). 

Solution: Try to implement a shared-memory model on top of a multi-computer. Example through virtual-memory techniques Map all main-memory pages (from different processors) into one single virtual address space. 

If a process at processor A addresses a page P located at processor B, the OS at A traps and fetches P from B, just as it would if P had been located on local disk. 

Problem
Performance of distributed shared memory could never compete with that of multiprocessors, and failed to meet the expectations of programmers. It has been widely abandoned by now.
 
Cluster Computing
- Essentially a group of high-end systems connected
- through a Local Area Network (LAN)
- Homogeneous: same OS, near-identical hardware
- Single managing node
 
 Grid Computing
The next step: lots of nodes from everywhere
• Flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources
• Enable communities “Virtual Organisations” to share geographically distributed resources as they pursue common goals

Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is an information technology infrastructure in which computing resources are virtualised and accessed as a service.
 
  Distinction between four layers:
1. Hardware: Processors, routers, power and cooling systems.
	Customers normally never get to see these
2. Infrastructure: Deploys virtualisation techniques. Evolves around allocating and managing virtual storage devices and virtual servers
3. Platform: Provides higher-level abstractions for storage and such.
4. Application: Actual applications, such as office suites (text processors, spreadsheet applications, presentation applications). Comparable to the suite of apps shipped with OSes.
