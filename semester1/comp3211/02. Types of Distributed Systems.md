#### Module Objectives
Three types of distributed systems
1. High performance distributed computing systems
2. Distributed information systems
3. Distributed systems for pervasive computing

High Performance Distributed Computing System
High-performance distributed computing started with parallel computing
â€¢ Multiprocessor and multi-core versus multi-computer 

Distributed Shared Memory systems 
Observation Multiprocessors are relatively easy to program in comparison to multi-computers, yet have problems when increasing the number of processors (or cores). 

Solution: Try to implement a shared-memory model on top of a multi-computer. Example through virtual-memory techniques Map all main-memory pages (from different processors) into one single virtual address space. 

If a process at processor A addresses a page P located at processor B, the OS at A traps and fetches P from B, just as it would if P had been located on local disk. 

Problem
Performance of distributed shared memory could never compete with that of multiprocessors, and failed to meet the expectations of programmers. It has been widely abandoned by now.
 
Cluster Computing
- Essentially a group of high-end systems connected
- through a Local Area Network (LAN)
- Homogeneous: same OS, near-identical hardware
- Single managing node
