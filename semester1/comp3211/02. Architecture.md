#### Module Objectives
Understand the different ways on how to view the organisation of a distributed system.

- Organisation of the distributed systems is mostly about the software components that constitute the system
- The software architectures tell us how the various software components are to be organized
- Goal: separate applications from underlying platforms by providing the middleware layer
- The instantiation of a software architecture (placement of software components on real machines) is referred to as a system architecture.
#### Architectural Style Is formulated in terms of:
- (replaceable) components with well-defined interfaces
- the way that components are connected to each other
- the data exchanged between components
- how these components and connectors are jointly configured into a system.

Component A has B’s interface.  Component B has C’s. C has E’s. D has B’s.
### Architectural Styles for Distributed Systems
1. Layered architectures
2. Object-based architectures
3. Resource-centred architectures
4. Event-based architectures - Publish-subscribe
Note: in (2) and (3), each entity encapsulates a service, object or microservice. More in lecture on Service oriented Architectures.
#### Layered Architectures
![[layered-architectures.png]](a) Pure layered organisation
(b) Mixed layered organisation
(c) Layered organisation with upcalls
