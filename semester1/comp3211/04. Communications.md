#### Module Objectives
 Interprocess communication is at the heart of
all distributed systems
• It is important to examine the ways that
processes on different machines can exchange
information
• Communication in distributed systems is
always based on low level message passing as
offered by the underlying network
• Some widely used models for
communication:
– Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
– Message Oriented Communication

Large Scale Data Transfer – The Appliance View
• Goal is to provide a “data
center in a box”
• Often combined with
networking capabilities such as
edge gateways and smart
routers
• Hard drive in a van:
high latency, high bandwidth!
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/using-device.html

Latency and Bandwidth
Latency: time until message arrives
• In the same building/datacenter: 1 ms
• One continent to another: 100 ms
• Hard drives in a van: 1 day
Bandwidth: data volume per unit time
• 5G cellular data: ≈ 5-20 Gbits/sec
• Home broadband: ≈ 300 Mbit/s
• Hard drives in a van: 50 TB/box ≈ 1 Gbit/s
(Very rough numbers, vary hugely in practice!)
Question: How long does it take to send a message of size S over a
communication link with bandwidth B and propagation delay T?
### Layered Protocols
![[layered-protocols.png]]Layers, interfaces, and protocols in the OSI model.
Question: How many layers does the TCP/IP protocol stack have?

Middleware Protocols
![[middleware-protocols.png]]
Middleware is invented to provide common services and protocols
that can be used by many different applications
• A rich set of communication protocols
• (Un)marshalling of data, necessary for integrated systems
• Naming protocols, to allow easy sharing of resources
• Security protocols for secure communication
• Scaling mechanisms, such as for replication and caching

##### Types of Communication (1)
![[communication-sync-ex.png]]
Distinguish between:
- Asynchronous versus synchronous communication
- Transient versus persistent communication
- Transient communication: Communication server discards message when it cannot be delivered at the next server, or at the receiver
- Persistent communication: a message is stored at a communication server as long as it takes to deliver it.
##### Types of Communication(2)
Some observations:
- Client/Server computing is generally based on a model of transient synchronous communication:
- Client and server have to be active at time of communication
- Client issues request and blocks until it receives reply
- Server essentially waits only for incoming requests, and subsequently processes them
Question: what are the drawbacks?
- Message-oriented middleware aims at high-level persistent asynchronous communication:
- Processes send each other messages, which are queued
- Sender needs not wait for immediate reply, but can do other things
- Middleware often ensures fault tolerance.

Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
Communication between caller and callee can be hidden by using
procedure-call mechanism.
![[rpc-example.png]]
• Application developers are familiar with simple procedure model
• Well-engineered procedures operate in isolation (black box)
• There is no fundamental reason not to execute procedures on
separate machine

RPC Example
// Online shop handling customers card details
```java
Card card = new Card();
card.setCardNumber(“9876 54321 0987 1234");
card.setExpiryDate("10/2025");
card.setCVC("123");

Result result = paymentsService.processPayment(card, 3.99, Currency.GBP);
if (result.isSuccess()) {
	fulfilOrder();
} 
```
Implementation of this function is on another node!
