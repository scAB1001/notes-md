#### Module Objectives
 Interprocess communication is at the heart of
all distributed systems
• It is important to examine the ways that
processes on different machines can exchange
information
• Communication in distributed systems is
always based on low level message passing as
offered by the underlying network
• Some widely used models for
communication:
– Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
– Message Oriented Communication

Large Scale Data Transfer – The Appliance View
• Goal is to provide a “data
center in a box”
• Often combined with
networking capabilities such as
edge gateways and smart
routers
• Hard drive in a van:
high latency, high bandwidth!

Latency and Bandwidth
Latency: time until message arrives
• In the same building/datacenter: 1 ms
• One continent to another: 100 ms
• Hard drives in a van: 1 day
Bandwidth: data volume per unit time
• 5G cellular data: ≈ 5-20 Gbits/sec
• Home broadband: ≈ 300 Mbit/s
• Hard drives in a van: 50 TB/box ≈ 1 Gbit/s
(Very rough numbers, vary hugely in practice!)
Question: How long does it take to send a message of size S over a
communication link with bandwidth B and propagation delay T?
### Layered Protocols
![[layered-protocols.png]]Layers, interfaces, and protocols in the OSI model.
Question: How many layers does the TCP/IP protocol stack have?

Middleware Protocols
![[middleware-protocols.png]]
Middleware is invented to provide common services and protocols
that can be used by many different applications
• A rich set of communication protocols
• (Un)marshalling of data, necessary for integrated systems
• Naming protocols, to allow easy sharing of resources
• Security protocols for secure communication
• Scaling mechanisms, such as for replication and caching
