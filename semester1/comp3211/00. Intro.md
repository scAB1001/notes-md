Potential option for supervisor.
#### Module Objectives
Ability to:
	identify the paradigms that determine the requirements, capabilities and performance of 	distributed systems
	design a high-level framework of a distributed system based on the Internet architecture /
	advanced architectures
	use a range of middleware tools to implement a distributed system
	reason about the significance of the new directions	that distributed systems are taking.

Use proscribed textbook and Computer Networking book (K. Ross). This is the module to get good at for job role next year. 

For this week, read the proscribed book and revise the following
1. Sockets programming
2. Multi-threading
3. Network programming

Goals
• Understand what a distributed system (DS) is
• Place distributed systems in a realistic context through examples
• Motivate the benefits of resource sharing
• Gain an understanding of some challenges as they apply to distributed systems

Overview:
• Definition of a DS
• Goals and challenges
• Sharing of resources
• Transparency
• Openness
• Scalability
• Summary
#### **Definition of a Distributed System** (1)
A distributed system is:
A collection of autonomous computing elements (nodes) that appears to its users as a single coherent system [TvS2024]

Nodes: Hardware devices and software processes (e.g. computer, car, robot). These nodes need to collaborate.
An autonomous node has its own notion of time. Every node has its own clock. There is no global clock: this is needed for synchronisation.

An autonomous node also needs to communicate to other nodes: this provides network support.
#### **Definition of a Distributed System** (2)
A system in which components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages [CDKB2017]

The collection of nodes as a whole operates the same –no matter where, when or how the interaction takes places between the user and that system.

E.g. An end-user cannot tell where the computation is taking place
Where data is stored exactly should be irrelevant to an application
Whether or not data has been replicated is completely unknown/hidden. (Distribution transparency)

“You know you have a DS when the crash of a computer you’ve never heard of stops you from getting any work done” – Leslie Lamport
##### **What’s the difference between a distributed and decentralised system?**

Decentralised → Distributed

Adding 1 link between 2 nodes? Adding k>0 nodes?

Realising distributed systems: Two views
•Integrative view: connecting existing networked computer systems into a larger a system
•Expansive view: an existing networked computer system is extended with additional computers

A **decentralised** system is a networked computer system in which processes and resources are necessarily spread across multiple computers.

A **distributed** system is a networked computer system in which processes and resources are sufficiently spread across multiple computers.
#### Challenges for Distributed Systems
• Architecture: common organisations, common styles
• Process: what kind of processes, and their relationships
• Communication: facilities for exchanging data
• Coordination: application-independent algorithms
• Naming: how do you identify resources?
• Consistency and replication: performance requires of data, which need to be the same
• Fault tolerance: keep running in the presence of partial failures
• Security: ensure authorised access to resources

What Do We Want to Achieve?
• Support sharing of resources: File sharing on p2p, shared web hosting, shared cloud-based storage
• Distribution transparency:
	The phenomenon by which a distributed system attempts to hide the fact that its processes and resources are physically distributed across multiple computers, possibly separated by large distances
	
	This is handled through many different techniques in a layer between applications and operating systems: a middleware layer: Multiple computers with varying OS will access the same interface and will eventually arrive at the same network.
#### Middleware is the OS of DS
Its the glue between apps and OS, extending over multiple machines; contains commonly used components and functions that need not be implemented by applications separately

Limited transparency: network services, e.g. sockets are directly visible to app dev
Significant amount of explicit code needed to establish comms between client and server (TCP/IP, UDP/IP)

Would be nice if …
– Client and server designed and implemented as if they were components of a centralised system
– Use of sockets could be hidden from programmer
• Openness
• Scalability
