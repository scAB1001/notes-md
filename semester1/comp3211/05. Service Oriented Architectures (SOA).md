#### Goals
- Understand the meaning of Service oriented Architecture
#### Overview:
- Conceptual Design of Software Systems
	- 1-Tier Architectures
	- 2-Tier Architectures
	- 3-Tier Architectures
	- N-Tier Architectures
- Emergence of SOAs
- Vision
- Characteristics
- Summary
#### Recap: Conceptual design of software systems Recap
 - At a conceptual level, the design component of a software system can be broken down into three layers
 - 1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier, N-Tier

#### N-tier Architectures
- Are the result of applying the 3-tier model in its full generality,
and of the increased relevance of the Internet as an access
channel.
- N-tier architectures arise from one of two situations:
	1. when the resource layer of a system not only includes simple resources like databases, but also fully-fledged two-tier or three- tier systems.
	2. where an additional tier is created by incorporating Web servers as part of the presentation layer (this is regarded as an additional tier due to the high complexity of the Web server).
- N-Tier architectures still face the same problems that 3-tier architectures do
- namely a lack of standards to facilitate interoperability between disparate systems
- Demonstrate the large amount of middleware required to integrate multiple systems together.
- This is especially true when the application logic is distributed across multiple machines, many of which may use differing middleware.
##### Trends in system evolution
- Software systems have evolved towards complex and decoupled n-tier systems.
- Software systems increasingly need to be integrated with existing (often legacy) systems from a variety of administrative domains, many of which may reside in different organisations.
### Service-Oriented Architectures
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style
- Applications built using an SOA style deliver functionality as services that can be used or reused when building applications or integrating within the enterprise or other organisations.
- Allow the easy development of applications composed of many dynamic, loosely-coupled, potentially inter-organisational systems.
- Are a paradigm shift from object-oriented systems to message-oriented systems, allowing software services to be invoked through platform- independent interface descriptions.

#### SOA Vision
- Resources
	- Computing, storage, data
- Communities
	- Operational procedures
- Services
	- Discovery, access …
- Connectivity
	- Reduce tyranny of distance
- Technologies
	- Build services & applications
#### What is a ‘Service’?
- A service is a reusable component that can be used as a building block to form larger, more complex business-application functionality you interact with via message exchanges
- A service may be as simple as “get me some person data,” or as complex as “process a disbursement.”
- Example:
	- Web services: link distributed applications together
	- Weather forecast service
	- Stock quote for a company
	- Translation engine
	- Credit check
	- Fraud detection
	- And anything else!
#### Architecture Model

##### Service Provision and Consumption

#### Differences between SOAs and traditional n-tier architectures
1. Decentralised middleware
	- For inter-service discovery and communication: is present within the hosting environment of each participating service
2. A strong emphasis on loose coupling
	- There are few, if any, interdependencies between services.
3. An adherence to well-supported standards
	- For constructing cross-organisational systems on a global scale, e.g. OASIS, W3C
##### Summary
- Decentralised middleware.
- Strong emphasis on loose coupling.
- Adherence to well- supported standards
