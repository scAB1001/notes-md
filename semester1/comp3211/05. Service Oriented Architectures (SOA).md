- Vision
- Characteristics
- Summary
#### Recap: Conceptual design of software systems Recap
 - At a conceptual level, the design component of a software system can be broken down into three layers
 - 1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier, N-Tier

#### N-tier Architectures
- Are the result of applying the 3-tier model in its full generality,
and of the increased relevance of the Internet as an access
channel.
- N-tier architectures arise from one of two situations:
	1. when the resource layer of a system not only includes simple resources like databases, but also fully-fledged two-tier or three- tier systems.
	2. where an additional tier is created by incorporating Web servers as part of the presentation layer (this is regarded as an additional tier due to the high complexity of the Web server).
- N-Tier architectures still face the same problems that 3-tier architectures do
- namely a lack of standards to facilitate interoperability between disparate systems
- Demonstrate the large amount of middleware required to integrate multiple systems together.
- This is especially true when the application logic is distributed across multiple machines, many of which may use differing middleware.
##### Trends in system evolution
⚫ Software systems have evolved towards complex
and decoupled n-tier systems.
⚫ Software systems increasingly need to be
integrated with existing (often legacy) systems
from a variety of administrative domains, many of
which may reside in different organisations.
### Service-Oriented Architectures (I)
⚫ Service-Oriented Architecture
(SOA)
⚫ is an architectural style
⚫ Applications built using an SOA
style deliver functionality as
services that can be used or reused
when building applications or
integrating within the enterprise or
other organisations.

Allow the easy development of
applications composed of many
dynamic, loosely-coupled,
potentially inter-organisational
systems.
⚫ Are a paradigm shift from
object-oriented systems to
message-oriented systems,
allowing software services to be
invoked through platform-
independent interface
descriptions.
