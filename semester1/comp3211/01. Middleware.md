#### Transparency 
**Transparency | Description**
Access Hide differences in data representation and how an object is accessed
Location Hide where an object is located
Migration Hide that an object may move to another location
Relocation Hide that an object may be moved to another location while in use
Replication Hide that an object is replicated
Concurrency Hide that an object may be shared by several competitive users
Failure Hide the failure and recovery of an object
  
Middleware and Openness
Open distributed system: a system that offers components that can easily be
used by, or integrated into other systems. An open distributed system itself will
often consist of components that originate from elsewhere.

They share the same interface and communicate with the same common protocol. Be able to interact with services from other open systems, irrespective of the underlying environment:

Systems should conform to well-defined interfaces, easily interoperate, support portability of applications and be easily extensible.
### Scalability
• We need to consider whether a DS scales in
– Size: number of users and/or processes
– Geographically: maximum distance between nodes
– Administratively: number of administrative domains, e.g. Google data centres worldwide

DS is scalable in size if it remains effective after a significant increase in the number of users/resources
– Example: Internet
– Poor scalability if cost of supporting n users is worse than O(n)
– Scalability improves if information is organised hierarchically rather than linearly; Cost becomes O(log(n))
#### Scalability Issues
• Geographically – Synchronisation and Communication
	• client sends request to server and waits for an answer: latency easily prohibits this scheme
	• Wide Area Networks (WAN) links are often inherently unreliable
• Administratively
– Dependent/independent administrative domains
– Possible conflicting policies
	• Resource usage, management, security
#### Scaling Techniques (1)
Hiding Communication latencies
The difference between letting:
	a) a server or
	b) a client check forms as they are being filled
#### Scaling Techniques (2)
Distribution & Domain Name Lookup and Addressing
• Name table for machines on the Internet was originally a single master file, held on one server
• Centralised approach works for a network consisting of a few hundred machines 
	– Does not scale well
• Domain Name System (DNS) partitions name table between servers distributed across the Internet, administered locally
• Hierarchical nature of DNS means that name lookup does not take twice as long when number of machines on the Internet doubles
#### Scaling Techniques (3)
Replication
• Replicate components across a DS
	– Increases availability
	– Helps balance the load between components
	– Can hide communication latency problems
• Drawback
	– Having multiple copies (cached or replicated), leads to inconsistencies: modifying one copy makes that copy different from the rest.
	– Always keeping copies consistent and in a general way requires global synchronisation on each modification.
	– Global synchronisation precludes large-scale solutions.
#### Developing Distributed Systems: Pitfalls
• Many distributed systems are needlessly complex caused by mistakes that required patching later
• Many false assumptions are often made:
1. The network is reliable
2. The network is secure
3. The network is homogeneous
4. Topology doesn't change
5. Latency is zero
6. Bandwidth is infinite
7. Transport cost is zero
8. There is one administrator

Question: Is there a 9th fallacy?
