#### Module Objectives
- Understand the different ways on how to view the organisation of a distributed system.
- Organisation of the distributed systems is mostly about the software components that constitute the system
- The software architectures tell us how the various software components are to be organized
- Goal: separate applications from underlying platforms by providing the middleware layer
- The instantiation of a software architecture (placement of software components on real machines) is referred to as a system architecture.
#### Architectural Style 
Is formulated in terms of:
- (replaceable) components with well-defined interfaces
- the way that components are connected to each other
- the data exchanged between components
- how these components and connectors are jointly configured into a system.

Component A has B’s interface.  Component B has C’s. C has E’s. D has B’s.
### Architectural Styles for Distributed Systems
1. Layered architectures
2. Object-based architectures
3. Resource-centred architectures
4. Event-based architectures - Publish-subscribe
Note: in (2) and (3), each entity encapsulates a service, object or microservice. More in lecture on Service oriented Architectures.
#### Layered Architectures
The basic idea for the layered style is simple: components are organized in a layered fashion where a component at layer Lj can make a downcall to a component at a lower-level layer Li (with i < j) and generally expects a response. Only in exceptional cases will an upcall be made to a higher-level component.

(b) Mixed layered organisation
(c) Layered organisation with upcalls
##### Layered communication protocol
A well-known and ubiquitously applied layered architecture is that of so-called communication-protocol stacks. In communication-protocol stacks, each layer implements one or several communication services allowing data to be sent from a destination to one or several targets. 

To this end, each layer offers an interface specifying the functions that can be called. 
In principle, the interface should completely hide the actual implementation of a service. Another important concept in the case of communication is that of a (communication) protocol, which describes the rules that parties will follow in order to exchange information.

It is important to understand the difference between a service offered by a layer, the interface by which that service is made available, and the protocol that a layer implements to establish communication.

To make this distinction clear, consider a reliable, connection-oriented
service, which is provided by many communication systems. In this case,
a communicating party first needs to set up a connection to another party
before the two can send and receive messages. Being reliable means that
strong guarantees will be given that sent messages will indeed be delivered to
the other side, even when there is a high risk that messages may be lost (as,
for example, may be the case when using a wireless medium). In addition,
such services generally also ensure that messages are delivered in the same
order as that they were sent.
This kind of service is realized in the Internet by means of the Transmis-
sion Control Protocol (TCP). The protocol specifies which messages are to
##### Application Layering: the PAD Model
Many client-server applications are constructed logically from three different layers of software

1. **Presentation layer**
- Contains everything required to interface with user of the system

2. **Application layer**
- A processing layer, containing core functionality of the system

3. **Data layer**
- Responsible for persistent storage of the data on which application layer operates
- Can map these layers onto a physical client-server architecture in various ways
