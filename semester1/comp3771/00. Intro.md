There is a need of personalisation within User Adaptive Systems.
One size does not fit all:
- Abundance and constraints such as bandwidth and time
- Custom for people: dependant on capabilities and background, goals, intentions, context and effective states

Types of personalisation
	User adaptable (customisable) systems: Where the user can modify aspects of the system to suit their preferences.
	User-adaptive systems: Modifies its own behaviour (with machine intelligence) independently from the user’s specific input
	Intermediate cases: System proposes possible adaptations and the user chooses from these options –still machine intelligence but with less automation.

Scenario-introduced Systems 
Travel assistant MoCoMapps (IBM)					COURSEWORK EXAMPLE 1
Need: lack of time, resources and money to the avg person.

Main Features:
	Input from user to customise the system behaviour
	Recommends nearby bike racks and restaurants
	Customisable interface for indicating user interests
	Registering notable points (e.g. bike racks)
	Presents a location map adapted to the user’s interests

Ecoach System: apersonalised Coach for University Students	COURSEWORK EXAMPLE 2
Need:

Main Features:
	Personalised to-do list
	Data from students in past years is used to recommend study materials
	Grades and what to do to achieve higher grades
	Motivational messages
	Customisable interface for indicating the learner’s goals and personal values
	Psychometric test to identify the learner’s self-regulation and motivation for studies
	Link to the university student information system
	Adaptive reminders & feedback
	Recommendation for learning and well-being activities

Some worked examples
In a website like YT’s case:
We know the following about the user:
	What and when the user has interacted with the screen (clicks) and how long they stayed in areas for.
	History of these as well as trends.
	Subscriptions
	Metadata

Learning Objectives
**LO|description**
LO1	apply human-computer interaction methodology to identify user needs, draw requirements, 	design, and evaluate user-adaptive systems
LO2 	identify most common techniques for user modelling and adaptation and apply them in 	practical areas
LO3 	implement one or more recommender system techniques in a practical application
LO4 	reason about the significance of user-adaptive systems and directions the field is going to 	develop

Expected Engagement
	Familiarise with material provided for each topic
	Prepare the practical tasks set in lectures
	Engage in discussions on module topics
	Complete in-course summative assessment
	Prepare for the terminal assessment
