Recap – in the Previous Lecture
- What is Personalisation
- Driving Factors of Personalisation
- Types of Personalisation
#### Today’s Learning Objectives
- Understand the general schema of a user-adaptive system
- This schema will be referred to regularly in the module
- Apply the schema to practical scenarios
- Reason about the importance of each of the components of the schema

#### Main definitions
User Model – data structure that contains explicit assumptions on all aspects of User that are relevant to the adaptive behaviour of System

User Model Acquisition – procedure that incrementally constructs the user model and its functions are to:
- store, update, and delete entries in the user model;
- maintain user model consistency; ensure user model validity.

User Model Application – procedure that uses the user model to:
- make predictions about U; take decisions about how to adapt to User

Example: SQL-Tutor

start at the end and see how it has ended up there. The program learns based on user constraints and behaviours.

Example: BBC-iPlayer

### Types of User-Adaptivity Support
Supporting System Use
- Taking over parts of routine tasks
- Adapting the interface
- Helping with system use
- Mediating interaction with the real world
- Controlling a dialogue

Supporting Information Acquisition
- Helping users to find information
- Recommending products
- Tailoring information presentation
- Supporting collaboration

#### LILSYS vs. AGENTSALON
What is the main purpose of the system?
Discussion: LILSYS
- What information is collected about the user?
- Do you see any concerns with regard to the information collected about the user?
- Can you give examples of contemporary systems which are similar to LILSYS?

**AGENTSALON - What is the main purpose of the system?**
Discussion:
- What adaptation is offered to the user?
- Do you see any concerns with regard to the adaptation?
- Can you give examples of contemporary systems which are similar to AGENTSALON?

Compare LILSYS and AGENTSALON
• Identify three similar things about both systems
• Identify three things where the systems differ

System Design
(example exam question)
The University of Leeds is (hypothetically) considering developing a module recommender to aid students in choosing which modules to study.

You are part of the team responsible for the design of the system. Following the general architecture of user-adaptive systems, draw the architecture of the module recommender.
Briefly outline:
- What user data will be collected and how?
- How will the user model be acquired?
- What will be included in the user model?
- How will the user model be applied to filter news?
- How will the filtered news be provided to the user?

#### Module Recommender
go through the main components
What will be stored in the user model
What information about the user be collected and how?
How will the interaction be adapted to the user?
How will the information about the user be processed to extract the user model?
How will the user model be applied to decide what and how to adapt?

Summary Topic 1:
You should be able to
 Understand the general schema of a user-adaptive
systems
 This schema will be referred to regularly in this module
 Apply the schema to practical scenarios
 Reason about the importance of each of the
components of the schema
