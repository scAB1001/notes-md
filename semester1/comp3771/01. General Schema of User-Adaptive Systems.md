Recap – in the Previous Lecture
- What is Personalisation
- Driving Factors of Personalisation
- Types of Personalisation
#### Today’s Learning Objectives
- Understand the general schema of a user-adaptive system
- This schema will be referred to regularly in the module
- Apply the schema to practical scenarios
- Reason about the importance of each of the components of the schema

#### Main definitions
User Model – data structure that contains explicit assumptions on all aspects of User that are relevant to the adaptive behaviour of System

User Model Acquisition – procedure that incrementally constructs the user model and its functions are to:
- store, update, and delete entries in the user model;
- maintain user model consistency; ensure user model validity.

User Model Application – procedure that uses the user model to:
- make predictions about U; take decisions about how to adapt to User

Example: SQL-Tutor

start at the end and see how it has ended up there. The program learns based on user constraints and behaviours.
