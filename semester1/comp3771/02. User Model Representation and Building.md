### Learning objectives
- Understand how systems represent and build user models
- Understand the main methods of user information collection
- Understand the main methods for representing a user model
- Understand the process of obtaining a user model
- Given a practical scenario, be able to decide what methods to apply and how
- Reason about the strengths and limitations of the methods

**Information about the user and User Model Acquisition**
User Information Collection
Understand the main methods of user information collection
Become aware of the strengths and limitations of each method
Given a practical scenario, be able to decide what information collection method can be used, and identify their strengths and limitations in that scenario

Explicit collection
- Entered by the user
- Fairly reliable
- Complies with privacy regulations
- Gives the user control

Implicit User Information
- Collection
- Information collected by the system
- Uses digital traces of user interaction
- Can also add information captured by the user device
### Techniques for Implicit User Information Collection

**Refer to the cwk sustainability examples for coursework**
### What can be modelled in a User Model/User Profile?
- Background
- Individual traits
- Context
- Interests
- Knowledge
- Goals and tasks

#### Background
A relatively stable set of user information about their previous experience

 Such as user’s profession, experience of work in related areas, specific opinions, …
 May also include demographic information such as name, age, sex, nationality, …
Example: Medical system which adapts to type of users (students, nurses, doctors)
#### Individual traits
A relatively stable set of user information that together define a user as an individual

 cognitive style (e.g. holist-analytic vs verbal-imagery)
 learning styles (e.g. video, audio, reading, …)
 Personality (e.g. openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism)
Can be based on psychometric tests, e.g.: http://discovermyprofile.com/
#### Context
Context awareness is paramount for mobile devices.

 Early work started from platform adaptation issues, then has grown to mobile & ubiquitous adaptive systems.
 Now extending to other dimensions of the context such as user location, physical environment, social context, and affective state.
 While not totally about the user, but addition of the context makes adaptation more effective

Dimensions of context
