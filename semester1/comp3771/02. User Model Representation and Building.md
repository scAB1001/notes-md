### Learning objectives
- Understand how systems represent and build user models
- Understand the main methods of user information collection
- Understand the main methods for representing a user model
- Understand the process of obtaining a user model
- Given a practical scenario, be able to decide what methods to apply and how
- Reason about the strengths and limitations of the methods

**Information about the user and User Model Acquisition**
User Information Collection
Understand the main methods of user information collection
Become aware of the strengths and limitations of each method
Given a practical scenario, be able to decide what information collection method can be used, and identify their strengths and limitations in that scenario

Explicit collection
- Entered by the user
- Fairly reliable
- Complies with privacy regulations
- Gives the user control

Implicit User Information
- Collection
- Information collected by the system
- Uses digital traces of user interaction
- Can also add information captured by the user device
### Techniques for Implicit User Information Collection

**Refer to the cwk sustainability examples for coursework**
### What can be modelled in a User Model/User Profile?
- Background
- Individual traits
- Context
- Interests
- Knowledge
- Goals and tasks

#### Background
A relatively stable set of user information about their previous experience

 Such as user’s profession, experience of work in related areas, specific opinions, …
 May also include demographic information such as name, age, sex, nationality, …
Example: Medical system which adapts to type of users (students, nurses, doctors)
#### Individual traits
A relatively stable set of user information that together define a user as an individual

 cognitive style (e.g. holist-analytic vs verbal-imagery)
 learning styles (e.g. video, audio, reading, …)
 Personality (e.g. openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism)
Can be based on psychometric tests, e.g.: http://discovermyprofile.com/
#### Context
Context awareness is paramount for mobile devices.
- Early work started from platform adaptation issues, then has grown to mobile & ubiquitous adaptive systems.
- Now extending to other dimensions of the context such as user location, physical environment, social context, and affective state.
- While not totally about the user, but addition of the context makes adaptation more effective.
##### Dimensions of context
![[dimensions-of-context.png]]
#### Representing Interests
Recommending News Imagine a user who is using a news site. 
- We want to recommend to the user news that they are interested in. 
- For this, the system has a user model that represents the user’s interests.
- We will discuss next how we will represent the user interests. 
The example is related to Google News: https://news.google.com/
(see article in Minerva in “References [Additional Reading - not needed for the exam]”)

**Keyword-level – list of words**
Example:
business, travel, planet, environment, global warming, ice melting, ...
- Interests may not map to content
- No linking between the keywords
- Hard to find relationships to recommend similar content

Overlay upon a list of known words
- Mobile
- Internet
- Music
- Celebrities

- Interests linked to content
- Recommendations linked to the existing content

**Concept level - an overlay model over a structure**
Graph of possible interests -- Using reasoning to infer relationships

For our example: https://news.google.com/
Pros
- Easier to find the categories/sub-categories
- Concept-based in terms of relations – allows linking/grouping content
- Allows content to be tagged with more than one category, so content can be found from more than one place
Cons
- Something (e.g. user’s views or content) may not fit the structure – user will be confused or content will be missed
- Depends on the quality of the graph

**Representing Knowledge/Skills**
Scalar models knowledge item: knowledge state
Example: Physics
knowledge: (novice – beginner – intermediate – expert)
Example: Cooking skills:
- based on years in cooking: (0,1,2,3,4,5)
Pros
- Simple and easy to implement
Cons
- Boundaries of categories not clear
- Granularity
- Variations of the scale not catered for
- Hard to explain

Use structural models: such as a graph model for domain with an overlay model for the user
- User knowledge (overlay)
- Domain knowledge (or expected expertise)
- Dependent on the quality of the knowledge model
