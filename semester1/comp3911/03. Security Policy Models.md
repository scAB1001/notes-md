### Objectives
- Overview of policy models.
- High level specification of security properties a system should possess.
- Clarify the security requirements for the system.
- Term “security” used very loosely!
#### SYSTEM PROTECTION
**Protection: Policy -> middleware -> mechanisms**
Policy: Concise, formalised set of goals, e.g., which user accesses which object.

Mechanisms: Basic components needed to satisfy policy, e.g., TCB, biometric scanning (for authentication), cryptographic primitives.

Middleware: How mechanisms are brought together to satisfy policy, e.g., ACL, cryptographic protocols.
#### SECURITY POLICY
Security policy —> set of high-level documents that state precisely what goals the protection mechanisms are to achieve
- driven by our understanding of threats
- drives our system design
- plays the same role in specifying the system's protection properties, and in evaluating whether they have been met

Consider this finite-state machine. It consists of four states and five transitions.
- The security policy partitions the states into a set of authorized states A = { s1, s2 } and a set of unauthorized states UA = { s3, s4 }.
- Is the system secure?
##### Hypothetical situation: Consider the above to be an (accounting) program.
- e.g., S1: cheque signed by Finance Director, S2: cheque checked by secretary, S3: (high value) cheque signed by CEO, S4: cheque in out tray.
- Security policy: NOT (S3) /\ NOT (S4). Secure?
- Security policy: (S3) => previously (NOT(S2)). Secure? (secretary should not see high value cheques).
- Security policy: (S3) => previously (S1). Secure? (all cheques signed by CEO should be first signed by Finance Director
#### POLICY LANGUAGES
- Express security policies in a precise way.
- High-level languages
	- Policy constraints expressed abstractly.
	- Constraints expressed independent of enforcement mechanism.
	- Constraints restrict entities, actions.
	- Constraints expressed unambiguously.
	- Requires a precise language, usually a mathematical, logical or programming-like language.
- Low-level languages
	- Policy constraints expressed in terms of program options, input or specific characteristics of entities on system.
	- Set of inputs or arguments to commands.
	- check or set constraints on a system.
	- Low level of abstraction.
	- Need details of system, commands.
#### WHY POLICY MODELS
Similar to building a house or decorating etc, very rare to design from scratch.

Security model: model that represent a particular policy or set of policies.
- Usually start with a model in mind.
- Start with something we understand or have experience with.
- Start with something whose properties are well-understood.
- Develop new policy if application novel etc

Key is to use the right policy model.
- Not use a house model for a kitchen.
- There are several models available. e.g., Bell-LaPadula, Biba etc.
