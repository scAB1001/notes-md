#### Recall
M: Method – skills and tools to attack the sys. Info about the sys may be available.
O: Opportunity – time and access for the attack e.g. sys can be accessed remotely
M: Motive – Attack target, financial, vulnerabilities

A threat is a set of circumstances that has the potential to cause harm or loss.

Hackers
	Used to be those who simply enjoyed tinkering with software
	
Different types of hacker
	White Hat: uses hacking skills ethically
	Black Hat: ‘bad guy’ (who the media really mean when they use the term ‘hacker’)

##### Bellovin’s Threat Matrix → ![[bellovin-threat-matrix.png]]
#### Advanced Persistent Threats
● Highly skilled attackers
● Targeted and prolonged cyber-attack campaigns
● Complex, multidimensional attacks, often tightly focused and very difficult to deflect (e.g., Stuxnet)
● ‘Cyber-warfare’ involving ‘state actors’ (e.g., national
intelligence agencies)
#### Module Content
	System design
		● Secure system design principles
		● Threat modelling
		● Formalisation etc
	Threats/Attacks
		● Malware
		● SQL/Python injection attacks
		● Buffer overflows etc
	Mitigation
	● Cryptography
	● Authentication
	● Network security
	● Intrusion detection etc

There is lots of overhead when it comes to configuring and setting up a firewall e.g. if you have a lot of checks running all the time.

 Multiple threats (insider + outsider).
For each asset, create attack goals for asset.
No threat without asset.
Threat mitigated by protecting assets.
Adversary hypotheses: Correlating threats to assets.
Know all security critical entities (e.g., ports) and threats to each identified.

THREAT ENUMERATION
Threat hypotheses form that violate security properties such as
confidentiality, integrity or availability.
Output: Threat profile that describes all potential attacks.
Threats classified in 6 categories, based on impact.

THREAT CLASSES (1)
Spoofing – masquerade, e.g., unauthorised access.
E.g., email spoofing: fake sender address appears to come from a trusted source.

Website spoofing: fraudulent site masquerades as legitimate to steal credentials.
Tampering - violates data integrity.
E.g., Hacker disabling anti-virus on a machine.

Man in the Middle Attack: intercepts/alters communication between two parties.
Repudiation - Deny performing action.
E.g., user denies making an online transaction and the system lacks sufficient evidence, like a digital signature, to prove otherwise.

Info disclosure - violate confidentiality.
E.g., Servers revealing directory structures, detailed messages exposing software/protocol versions

Denial of Service
E.g., Mirai botnet: Consisted of large number of IoT devices such as IP cameras.
Instructed to send large number traffic to Dyn (DNS provider) servers. Prevent system from providing designated service.
Elevation of privilege - Gaining special status.
E.g., Flaw in OS (buffer overflow). Ultimately, get admin privilege.
