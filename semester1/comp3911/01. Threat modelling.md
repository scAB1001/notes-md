#### Recall
M: Method – skills and tools to attack the sys. Info about the sys may be available.
O: Opportunity – time and access for the attack e.g. sys can be accessed remotely
M: Motive – Attack target, financial, vulnerabilities

A threat is a set of circumstances that has the potential to cause harm or loss.

Hackers
	Used to be those who simply enjoyed tinkering with software
	
Different types of hacker
	White Hat: uses hacking skills ethically
	Black Hat: ‘bad guy’ (who the media really mean when they use the term ‘hacker’)

##### Bellovin’s Threat Matrix → ![[bellovin-threat-matrix.png]]
#### Advanced Persistent Threats
● Highly skilled attackers
● Targeted and prolonged cyber-attack campaigns
● Complex, multidimensional attacks, often tightly focused and very difficult to deflect (e.g., Stuxnet)
● ‘Cyber-warfare’ involving ‘state actors’ (e.g., national
intelligence agencies)
#### Module Content
	System design
		● Secure system design principles
		● Threat modelling
		● Formalisation etc
	Threats/Attacks
		● Malware
		● SQL/Python injection attacks
		● Buffer overflows etc
	Mitigation
	● Cryptography
	● Authentication
	● Network security
	● Intrusion detection etc

There is lots of overhead when it comes to configuring and setting up a firewall e.g. if you have a lot of checks running all the time.

**Multiple threats (insider + outsider).**
For each asset, create attack goals for asset.
No threat without asset.
Threat mitigated by protecting assets.
Adversary hypotheses: Correlating threats to assets.
Know all security critical entities (e.g., ports) and threats to each identified.

**THREAT ENUMERATION**
Threat hypotheses form that violate security properties such as
confidentiality, integrity or availability.
Output: Threat profile that describes all potential attacks.
Threats classified in 6 categories, based on impact.
#### THREAT CLASSES
**Spoofing** – masquerade, e.g., unauthorised access.
E.g., email spoofing: fake sender address appears to come from a trusted source.
Website spoofing: fraudulent site masquerades as legitimate to steal credentials.

**Tampering** - violates data integrity.
E.g., Hacker disabling anti-virus on a machine.

**Man in the Middle Attack**: intercepts/alters communication between two parties.

**Repudiation** - Deny performing action.
E.g., user denies making an online transaction and the system lacks sufficient evidence, like a digital signature, to prove otherwise.

**Info disclosure** - violate confidentiality.
E.g., Servers revealing directory structures, detailed messages exposing software/protocol versions

**Denial of Service**
E.g., Mirai botnet: Consisted of large number of IoT devices such as IP cameras.
Instructed to send a large number of traffic to Dyn (DNS provider) servers. Prevent the system from providing the designated service.

**Elevation of privilege** - Gaining special status.
E.g., Flaw in OS (buffer overflow). Ultimately, get admin privileges.

THREATS
Helpful to think of attacks in terms of above classification.
Also classified in terms of breaches of confidentiality, integrity or availability.
e.g., data in transit from A to B, can be tampered with, violating integrity, can then use Secure
Hashing Algorithm.
Also need to decide whether a system is susceptible to a given threat!
### Objectives
● For you to appreciate the importance of threat
modelling in secure software development
● For you to understand the value of data flow diagrams
and STRIDE to explore threats
● For you to see how attack trees can be used for risk
assessment and threat mitigation

Threat Modelling Goals
● Understand system’s threat profile
● Facilitate secure design and implementation
○ Identify and justify need for security features
○ Prescribe implementation practices
● Guide code reviews and penetration tests
● Discover vulnerabilities

Software-focused approach is considered to be the best; see Shostack’s book for detailed explanation

Three Different Perspectives to focus on
● Assets
● Attackers
● Software

**Assets**
● “The valuable things you have”
● Can be tangible, obvious targets for attackers
○ User credentials
○ Credit card / bank account details
○ Confidential business data
○ etc…
● There are also intangible things you may need to protect (system availability, company reputation, etc)

**Attacker Lists**
● Can help with brainstorming
● Talking about human threat agents helps to make the threat more real – useful when dealing with management?
● May not provide enough structure / detail to help people figure out what an attacker might do
● Easy for modeller to subconsciously project their own biases when creating or using an attacker list

Aucsmith’s ‘Threat Personas’
(from Shostack, Threat Modeling)

**Thinking About Threats**
● Unstructured (‘brainstorming’)
● Moderately structured
○ Participants explore what could go wrong in a specific scenario, use case or user story
○ Protection Poker – analogous to the ‘Planning
Poker’ game used by agile development teams
● Highly structured
○ System diagrams (data flow, C4)
○ STRIDE classification
○ Attack trees
