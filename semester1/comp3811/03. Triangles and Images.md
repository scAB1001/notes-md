#### Triangle
- In 3D: We will define facing based on order of vertices
- CCW is by default front facing, CW is back facing
- Typically cull (=discard) back facing triangles for efficiency
- This is configurable, however
- Can set CW to be front facing, CCW back facing
- Can also choose to cull front facing triangles, none, or both

Half-plane test, you get to choose
- Inside: positive sign
- Outside: negative sign
- Either: all tests have the same sign
##### Generalization
- Approach with half-plane works for any convex shape
- Extends into 3D
- kDOP? (discrete oriented polytope = set of oriented slabs)

Rasterizing triangles
- Can tell if point is in triangle. E.g. half-plane test.
- Last time: “pixels = center samples”
- Test each sample position
	- Maybe a bit overkill?
- Can reduce number quite a bit (But still some unnecessary tests.)

Variations of this are common
- Raster stamp on GPUs
- “Larrabee” hierarchical rasterization

Compare: implicit vs explicit
- More like implicit: test points against triangle
- Explicit: enumerate points in triangle?
### Barycentric coordinates
In computer graphics, barycentric coordinates are ==used to represent a point's position within a triangle as a weighted average of its vertices==, allowing for operations like texture mapping and color interpolation. 
- This system is useful for tasks such as rasterization, determining if a point is inside a triangle, and applying lighting or shading across its surface. 
- The coordinates (α,β,γ)open paren alpha comma beta comma gamma close paren
(𝛼,𝛽,𝛾)
are defined such that they sum to 1 (
α+β+γ=1alpha plus beta plus gamma equals 1
𝛼+𝛽+𝛾=1
) and are all non-negative (α,β,γ≥0alpha comma beta comma gamma is greater than or equal to 0 (𝛼,𝛽,𝛾≥0).
- Linear interpolation across triangle
- 𝐶𝑃 = 𝛼 𝐶0 + 𝛽 𝐶1 + 𝛾 𝐶2
#### Interpolation
- Arbitrary “attributes”
- Easy to show with colors
- Depth (for depth buffering / hidden surface removal)
- Texture coordinates (for texture mapping)
- Surface normals (for lighting)
- Tangent space bases (for normal mapping)
- Note: 3D: need to correct for perspective. (extra interpolation)
##### Equation: 𝐶𝒙 = 𝛼 𝐶𝑜 + 𝛽 𝐶1 + 𝛾 𝐶2
Properties:
- Each of 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝛾 should be in the range [0 … 1]
	- 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛾 = 1, 𝛼 < 1, 𝛽 < 1, 𝛾 < 1
- First property: inside of space spanned by 𝐶𝑜, 𝐶1 and 𝐶2
- Second property: conserve “energy”
#### Sketch
- Line: 1 − 𝑡 𝑃 + 𝑡 𝑄, 𝑡 ∈ [0 … 1]
- Works for any point V in triangle

𝑉 = (1 − 𝑠) 𝐶 + 𝑠 𝑈
𝑉 = (1 − 𝑠) 𝐶 + 𝑠 ((1 − 𝑡) 𝐴 + 𝑡 𝐵)
𝑉 = (1 − 𝑠) 𝐶 + (1 − 𝑡) 𝑠 𝐴 + 𝑠 𝑡 𝐵
𝑉 = 𝛾 𝐶 + 𝛼 𝐴 + 𝛽 𝐵, with 𝛼 = (1 − t) s, 𝛽 = 𝑠 𝑡 and 𝛾 = (1 − s)
#### Barycentric coordinates
- Properties: 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾 ∈ 0 … 1 and 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛾 = 1 with 𝛼 = 1 − t s, 𝛽 = 𝑠 𝑡 and 𝛾 = (1 − s)

The barycentric coordinates of a point are 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾
- Relative to a specific triangle ABC
- 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾 ∈ [0 … 1]
- 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛾 = 1
- The properties also imply 𝛾 = 1 − 𝛼 − 𝛽

Given a point X: can we compute its barycentric coordinate
