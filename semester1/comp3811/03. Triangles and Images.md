Triangle
- In 3D: We will define facing based on order of vertices
- CCW is by default front facing, CW is back facing
- Typically cull (=discard) back facing triangles for efficiency
- This is configurable, however
- Can set CW to be front facing, CCW back facing
- Can also choose to cull front facing triangles, none, or both

If you use the half-plane test, you get to choose
- Inside: positive sign
- Outside: negative sign
- Either: all tests have the same sign

Generalization
- Approach with half-plane works for any convex shape
- Extends into 3D
- kDOP? (discrete oriented polytope = set of oriented slabs)

Rasterizing triangles
- Can tell if point is in triangle
- E.g. half-plane test.
- Last time: “pixels = center samples”
- Test each sample position
	- Maybe a bit overkill?
- Can reduce number quite a bit
(But still some unnecessary tests.)

Variations of this are common
- Raster stamp on GPUs
- “Larrabee” hierarchical rasterization
Compare: implicit vs explicit
- More like implicit: test points against triangle
- Explicit: enumerate points in triangle?

Barycentric coordinates
- Linear interpolation across triangle
- 𝐶𝑃 = 𝛼 𝐶0 + 𝛽 𝐶1 + 𝛾 𝐶2
