If resolution is too high to see the pixels:
#### CWK1
- Command line options (see `readme`)
```bash
	--geometry=NxM     (example –geometry=1280x720)
	--fbshift=S        (example –fbshift=1)
```
### Images and Pixels
- Pixel: picture element
- Texel: texture element
- Voxel: volume element
- (Froxel: frustum element(Not as widely accepted.)

Image: grid of pixels
- Raster image
- Vector images a separate topic
- Raster: “a rectangular pattern of parallel [...] lines [...]”
#### Storage
- Array of pixels
- Can use 2D array
- Usually single 1D array (see Exercise 1's surface)
- Same thing: 2D array is stored in linear (=1D) memory
- Doing it "by hand" gives more flexibility
- Nested std::vector<> et al. usually a bad idea...


RGBA/RGBX: 4 bytes
Width = 5 pixels, Height=5 pixels
(Row) stride = 5 * 4 bytes = 20 bytes
First row starts at offset 0, Second row at offset 20

#### Access
Use the method of access that relates best to how the image is stored.

**Row-major**
```cpp
for( std::size_t xi = xmin; xi < xmax; ++xi )
{
	for( std::size_t yi = ymin; yi < ymax; ++yi )
		Change pixel (xi, yi)
}
```
**Column-major**
```cpp
for( std::size_t yi = ymin; yi < ymax; ++yi )
{
	for( std::size_t xi = xmin; xi < xmax; ++xi )
		Change pixel (xi, yi)
}
```
#### Summary
- Images are stored in memory
- Most common
- Interleaved storage, row major
- RGBx or RGBA
- 8bits / channel = 32 bits in total
### Systems
#### Simplest system
- Video memory is just memory
- Write to video memory
- Screen updated next refresh

#### Modern systems
- More complex
- Screen: shared resource, multiple applications
- Compositor transforms/combines their outputs
- Event handling
- Input devices

##### System Overview
![[sys-overview-os-services.png]]![[sys-overview-opengl-glfw.png]]
### GLFW
- Simple, lightweight library for OpenGL applications
- And Vulkan these days
- Create & manage windows
- Receive events
- Mouse, keyboard
- OS events (window resized, closed, ...)
- Joystick support.
#### Structure
```cpp
- glfwInit()
- glfwCreateWindow()
  ```
- Main Loop (“Hidden” inside `QApplication::exec()`)
	- Pump events
	- Update & Draw
	- Submit for display
-  ```cpp
	- (glfwDestroyWindow())
	- glfwTerminate
	``` 
#### Event Handling
- Qt: Signal + Slot
	- GLFW: Callback functions (or polling)
- GLFW: must pump events
	```cpp
	- glfwWaitEvents() – block until next event
	- glfwPollEvents() – check for events, return immediately
  ```
- Can call multiple times per frame...
#### Callbacks vs. Polling
- Two different ways of doing input.
- Callbacks:
	- System tells us when something happens
	- Suggest using this.
- Polling:
	- We repeatedly ask the system about its state
	- Example: `glfwGetKey()` (need to call that for each key!)
	- Avoid!

**Callbacks**
- GLFW notifies us by calling a function
- Just a normal function
- Address passed to e.g. GLFW so that GLFW knows how to call it

Tangent: Function pointers?
```cpp
using FuncPtr = void (*)(void);
// ...
FuncPtr fptr = &some_void_func();
// ...
fptr();

```
Callback functions
```cpp
struct CallLater
{
	using FuncPtr_ = void (*)(void);
	void set( FuncPtr_ aPtr ) { fptr = aPtr; }
	void call() { fptr(); }
	FuncPtr_ fptr = nullptr;
};
```
Callback functions, II
```cpp
void func()
{
	std::printf( "Hello\n" );
}
int main()
{
	CallLater cl;
	cl.set( &func );
	std::printf( "Test:\n" );
	cl.call();
	cl.call();
	return 0;
}
```
GLFW: Key Input
- `glfwSetKeyCallback()` to register callback function
- `void callback_function( GLFWwindow*, int, int, int, int );`
- Window that received the event
- Key code (identifies which key)
- “Scan code” (also identifies key, but not portable)
- Action (`GLFW_PRESS` or `GLFW_RELEASE; GLFW_REPEAT`)
- Modifiers bitmask (status of shift, alt, ctrl, ...)

### Vector Algebra
Core items
- Points & Vectors
- Coordinate systems
- Different spaces
- Transforms
- Types of transforms
- Sequences of transforms / hierarchical transforms
- Matrices
- Represent transforms
![[vector-camera-image-ex.png]]Markus' take in COMP3811
- Less focus on the how, more on the what/why
- Computer can do computations with numbers
- We need to understand what we need to do
- My opinion:
	- Intuitive understanding of this more important than the details
	- But: should see the details at least once.
- More in-depth
- “Immersive linear algebra” [ILA] Ström, Åström & Akenine-Möller http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html

Points
- Points: exist without a coordinate system
- If we want to describe them, we use a coordinate system
- Multiple possible coordinate systems
	- In fact, (uncountable) infinitely many
- Different “types” of coordinate systems
	- E.g., cartesian vs. polar coordinates

Coordinate systems
- We will encounter a few different ones
- Will call them “spaces” normally
- E.g., screen space, world space, model space, tangent space, ...
- Comes from “vector space”
- Generalization of coordinate system
- Later: transformations can take us from one space to another
