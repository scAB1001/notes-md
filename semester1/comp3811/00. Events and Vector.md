If resolution is too high to see the pixels:
#### CWK1
- Command line options (see `readme`)
```bash
	--geometry=NxM     (example –geometry=1280x720)
	--fbshift=S        (example –fbshift=1)
```

Images and Pixels
- Pixel: picture element
- Texel: texture element
- Voxel: volume element
- (Froxel: frustum element(Not as widely accepted.)

Image: grid of pixels
- Raster image
- Vector images a separate topic
- Raster: “a rectangular pattern of parallel [...] lines [...]”

Storage?
- Array of pixels
- Can use 2D array
- Usually single 1D array (see Exercise 1's surface)
- Same thing: 2D array is stored in linear (=1D) memory
- Doing it "by hand" gives more flexibility
- Nested std::vector<> et al. usually a bad idea...
