Look at solutions to exercises.

Transformations
- Lines (implicit/explicit forms, rasterization, clipping & culling)
- Start on triangles?

Tangent
- What do we mean by multiplying two vectors?
- Mathematics:
- Dot product (·), cross product (×), convolution(∗), …
- Programming: often "u * v" for element-wise multiplication
- Example: GLSL
- Mathematical notation: compare to convolution...
- Use something distinct. I will use ⊗ for this
Typically a function:
- GLSL: built-in as dot( a, b )
- We will also use a function dot() in C++
(but have to define it ourselves)

Classes of Transformations
- General: Transformation maps elements from one set to another
- Example: Transformation from a 2D space to a 2D space
𝑇 ∶ 𝑅2 → 𝑅2

Types of Transformations
- Linear transformation:
T(x) = A x (A matrix, x vector)
- Affine transformation:
T(x) = A x + b (b also vector)

Linear transformations
- Linear transforms require that for a transform T
𝑇 𝒖 + 𝒗 = 𝑇 𝒖 + 𝑇(𝒗) and
𝑇 𝑐 𝒖 = 𝑐 𝑇(𝒖)
- Examples: rotation, scaling, shear
- Can be written as
T(x) = A x (A matrix, x vector)

 Affine transformation
- Superset of linear transformations
- Can be written as
T(x) = A x + b (b also vector)
- Affine: any linear, and translation
- Of the most common ones, translation is the strange one out.
- Homogenous coordinates “unify” translations with the rest

Matrices  
- Let’s quickly look at a few common matrices

2025/2026  
COMP3811 – Computer Graphics  
Identity  
1 0  
0 1  
- Does nothing:  
1 0  
0 1  
𝑢𝑥  
𝑢𝑦 = 1 𝑢𝑥 + 0 𝑢𝑦  
0 𝑢𝑦 + 1 𝑢𝑦  
= 𝑢𝑥  
𝑢𝑦

COMP3811 – Computer Graphics  
Scaling  
𝑠𝑥 0  
0 𝑠𝑦  
- Scales a vector:  
𝑠𝑥 0  
0 𝑠𝑦  
𝑢𝑥  
𝑢𝑦 = 𝑠𝑥 𝑢𝑥 + 0 𝑢𝑦  
0 𝑢𝑦 + 𝑠𝑦 𝑢𝑦  
= 𝑠𝑥 𝑢𝑥  
𝑠𝑦 𝑢𝑦  
- Uniform scaling if 𝑠𝑥 = 𝑠𝑦  
- Not orthonormal!  
u  
S u  
u S’ u  
2 0  
0 2  
2 0  
0 1

Rotation  
cos 𝜃 − sin 𝜃  
sin 𝜃 cos 𝜃  
- Rotates a vector around the origin  
- Orthonormal  
- Preserves length of vector  
𝒖 = 𝑅 𝒖  
(In theory – in practice, accumulating rotations by consecutive  
multiplications with rotation matrices will introduce errors.)  
u  
R u

COMP3811 – Computer Graphics  
Rotation  
- Orthonormal, so inverse = transpose  
cos 𝜃 − sin 𝜃  
sin 𝜃 cos 𝜃  
𝑇  
= cos 𝜃 sin 𝜃  
− sin 𝜃 cos 𝜃

COMP3811 – Computer Graphics  
Rotation  
- Orthonormal, so inverse = transpose  
cos 𝜃 − sin 𝜃  
sin 𝜃 cos 𝜃  
𝑇  
= cos 𝜃 sin 𝜃  
− sin 𝜃 cos 𝜃  
cos is symmetric around zero: cos 𝜃 = cos −𝜃  
sin is anti-symmetric around zero: −sin 𝜃 = sin −𝜃  
cos 𝜃 sin 𝜃  
− sin 𝜃 cos 𝜃 = cos −𝜃 − sin −𝜃  
sin −𝜃 cos −𝜃

Shear

0 1 or 1 0  
𝜆 1  
- See figures on the right. :-)  
- Not the most useful transform

General inverses of matrices  
- “Reverses a transform”  
- Not all matrices are invertible …  
… but the ones we will work with mostly are!  
- In 2D:  
For 𝑀 = 𝑎 𝑏  
𝑐 𝑑 , then 𝑀−1= 1  
𝑎𝑑−𝑏𝑐  
𝑑 −𝑏  
−𝑐 𝑎  
- Note the fraction. If 𝑎𝑑 − 𝑏𝑐 = 0…
