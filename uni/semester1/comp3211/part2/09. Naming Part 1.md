#### Goals: understand
principles behind
naming in a
distributed system
#### Outline
• Fundamental
concepts
• Classes of naming
systems
• Namespaces
• Naming graphs
• Conclusion
####  Definitions
• Entities in any computer system must be given names if we are to
have access to them.
	– Entity is a resource such as a computer, printer, disk, file, web page, newsgroup, remote object . . .
	– Name is a string of bits or characters (possibly human-readable)
• Names must be bound to attributes of an entity; normally, one of those attributes will give us access to the entity.
• Name is resolved when we translate it into those attributes.
• In a distributed system, the implementation of a naming system is itself often described across multiple machines.
