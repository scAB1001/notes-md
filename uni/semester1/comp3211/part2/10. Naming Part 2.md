a. Broadcasting
b. Forwarding pointers
c. Home-based approaches
d. Distributed Hash Tables
e. Hierarchical approaches
2. Structured naming (this lecture)
3. Attribute-based naming (this lecture)
#### Goals: 
understand principles behind naming in a distributed system
#### Outline
• Structured naming
– Namespaces
– Name resolution
– Implementation of a namespace
Examples
• Attribute-based naming
• Directory Services
• Conclusion
#### Flat vs Structured Naming
• Flat names are
– good for machines
– generally not very convenient for humans to use
• Alternative:
– Naming systems support structured names that are composed from single, human-readable names
– File naming, host naming on the Internet follows this approach.
• Next
– Explore how structured names and the way that these names are resolved to addresses.
