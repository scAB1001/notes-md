- Summary
##### Recap - SOAs
• Decentralised middleware.
• Strong emphasis on loose
coupling.
• Adherence to well-
supported standards.

Microservices
• A microservice architecture follows an SOA pattern by
breaking a single application into multiple loosely coupled,
independent services yet working with each other.
• Often considered the perfect use case of
containerisation
• Microservices are deployed on separate containers
– E.g. Docker
