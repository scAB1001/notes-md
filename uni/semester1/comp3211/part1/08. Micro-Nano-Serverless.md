#### Goals
- Understand the concept of microservices, nanoservices and serverless architectures 
#### Overview
- Recap: SOAs
- Microservices
- Nanoservices
- Serverless Computing
- Function as a Service
- Architectural Support
- Solutions
- Summary
##### Recap - SOAs
• Decentralised middleware.
• Strong emphasis on loose
coupling.
• Adherence to well-
supported standards.
#### Microservices
• A microservice architecture follows an SOA pattern by
breaking a single application into multiple loosely coupled,
independent services yet working with each other.
• Often considered the perfect use case of
containerisation
• Microservices are deployed on separate containers
– E.g. Docker

**Microservices**
• Smaller-grained services
• Specified Functionality
• Defined Capabilities

**Microservices Architecture**
• Event handler
• Containerisation
• Data processing

**Features**
• Developed and tested in isolation
• Organised by the processes they handle
• Deployed independently

Go from monoliths to microservices

#### Virtual Machines versus Containers

![[container-arch-ex.png]]![[vm-arch-ex.png]]
Container virtualises the OS rather than the hardware
• Uses a single kernel to run multiple instances of an operating
system
– Each instance runs in a completely isolated environment
– Is secure.
• Can offer greater efficiency and performance than a conventional
hypervisor

Applications, Code and Dependencies
▪ Applications aren’t just code, they have dependencies
