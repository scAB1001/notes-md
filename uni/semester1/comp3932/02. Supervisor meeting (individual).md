### To-do
- Research
- Send list of titles suing project 10: VR/AR
	- Consider deliverables first
- Share word-doc/overleaf project + email
- Meet after project synopsis
- Research how to use unity - mesh simplification, *meshlab*
- ==Gradescope==
#### Notes
- Liver examples already exist, use the existing paper as a starting point
- VR/AR (Dora)  - computer access, unity software, camera system is an option and could be integrated as part of the project
- Hand tracking device (Â£500)
	- XR-4 SERIES, SoC
	- Can only work on-premise in the lab
- Use magic leap2, connect with unity value (headset)
	- idea is to replace the joy-sticks with hand-based rendering (software project)
	- API exists already but need to integrate your own 
		- REPLACE joystick with hand-movements
			- CV: "I divised this handtracked for my project to do 3D manipulation of the medical scene (LIVER)"
			- Loading in the 3D models llike liver, etc but the hand-tracking/movements are the goal. Immersion 
			- Interactive, user-friendly, VR/AR clinical training with real 3D models
	- How to transform the 3D segmentation of a model, there are many problems there (scaling etc)
		- Mesh issues, holes in the mesh, mesh simplification - how would you simplify the dense meshes?
		- Take mesh, simplify so that it is topologically consistent to preserve shape, load mesh into AR/VR environment, make a user-friendly navigation system through hand-tracking - existing tracking software is a C program that uses joystick
	- **CANNOT BE PUBLIC** -  code snippet in thesis
	- Ethics: Publicly available datasets
	- Business wise: company funded by hollowcare, used in gaming industry and visualisation - healthcare technologies, growing currently, requires bespoke software engineering and skills, combines SME + Engineering (BA)

### Neat
##### Artificial intelligence in Medicine and Surgery (AIMS group)

##### Original Problem
**Project 10: Virtual Reality for right hemicolectomy planning**
Example segmentation of the trunk of Henle. This is a type 3 (GPCT with two colic veins), involving SRCV, RCV, ASPDV and RGEV - *Mr Mikolaj R Kowal*

##### New problem
The old model, much like others, is controlled using joysticks. 
- [Downsides]
##### Solution
- There are plenty of real liver and colon 3D models available to use
- Varjo XR-4 series - VR headset (Can only work on-premise in the lab, property of SoC)
- Magic Leap 2 - VR headset
- Using one of the VR headsets and connecting to the API, load in a 3D model and integrate the handtracking to allow user-friendly navigation around it
