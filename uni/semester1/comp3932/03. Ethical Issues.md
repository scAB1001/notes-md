### Outline
We'll be looking at ethical issues that might arise in your projects and how to manage these.
1. Two common issues in computing projects
	a) Consent
	b) Privacy and anonymity
2. Six areas of block ethical approval
	a) Images of people
	b) Medical images
	c) Use of religious texts
	d) User testing
	e) Use of data from the internet
	f) Working with NHS staff
3. Applying this to a case study
#### 1 . Common Issues in Computing Projects
##### Consent
Each person has a right to control their body, property, and who has access to these.
• Includes access to data, which is property of the subject and is about them.
• Consent is a kind of permission-giving; it often, but not perhaps always, makes an act ethically permissible.
• Securing a person’s consent before collecting or accessing their data is important for respecting their autonomy and boundaries.
• Sometimes people can’t consent due to mental impairment, e.g. very old and very young.
• A person does not properly consent to something if they are pressured into agreeing or do not understand what they are agreeing to.
• So, consent must be:
	• Free
	• Informed
• If your project involves collecting data about users, this presents a risk.
• In that case, you must have the informed consent of users.
• Fully informed about what their data is used for, and what data is collected.
##### Privacy and Anonymity
Consent is also important because it relates to privacy.
• Privacy is important:
• For individuality of thought and expression
• For freedom from control
• For regulating boundaries in relationships
• For control over who experiences us
• Lack of privacy hinders human flourishing in fiction (George Orwell’s 1984) and totalitarian regimes (eg. North Korea).

If data identifies a person, then it is personal data.
• Collecting personal data creates a risk of harm:
• Discrimination (belonging to oppressed groups; religion, sexuality, ethnicity)
• Social disadvantages (mental health history, criminal record)
• Identity fraud, targeted marketing, harassment
• Violating someone’s choice/autonomy: should be up to individuals what data is collected about them
##### Personal Data: Direct and Indirect Indicators
**Direct Indicators**
Can be used to directly identify the data subject.
• Unique to a person.
• Includes:
• Name/initials
• Address, including full or partial post code
• Telephone numbers or email addresses
• Unique identifying numbers (NI number, NHS number)
• Vehicle identifiers
• Medical device identifiers
• IP addresses
• Facial photographs
• Names of relatives
• Individual dates

**Indirect Indicators**
Can be used in conjunction with other information (direct or indirect) to identify data subjects.
• Includes:
• Place of treatment or GP name
• Sex
• Place of birth
• Socio-economic data (income, etc.)
• Ethnicity
• Age
• Household or family constitution
• Illicit drug use, or other substance use
• Rare diseases and treatments
• Transcripts or verbatim responses
##### Data Linkage
- “Data linkage” can occur when two (or more) pieces of information from different sources are brought together.
-  This can identify a data subject, or reveal information that is not available in one dataset.
-  This means that even if data is anonymized within the context of its own data set, linkage may de-anonymize the data.
### 2. Six Areas of Block Ethical Approval
- There are some kinds of data that you are approved to collect as part of this module.
• However, each of these must be collected, stored, and processed in line with certain guidelines and restrictions.
##### a) Images of people
• Your project might involve using still or moving images of
people
• For instance:
• Tracking individuals in crowded scenes
• Facial feature recognition
• Projects might use new or pre-existing images

• New images:
	• Proper consent forms collected
	• Participants given all appropriate information necessary for
informed consent.
• Existing images only be taken from legitimate sources
• When public filming, impact assessments performed to
determine whether individuals can be identified.
##### b) Medical images
• Your project might involve the application of algorithms to
medical images.
• For instance:
	• Automating the detection of cancerous tissue
	• Developing interfaces to help with the visualization of tissue
samples
• The project might use images from people’s medical
records.

**Ethical issues involved in using medical images?**
 Anonymization – Medical data is private; can be sensitive,
embarrassing
 Storage / misuse / theft – medical data desirable
 Legitimacy of sources
**What should be done to avoid potential problems?**
 Ensure that the images are taken from legitimate source
 Ensure images anonymized (you should receive them anonymized,
but there could be mistakes)
 Ensure storage is secure
##### c) Use of religious texts
Projects in the field of Natural Language Processing can
involve the automated analysis of text
• These can be religious texts
• For instance:
	• Categorization of verses in the Quran
	• Machine Translation of the Quran into other languages

**Ethical issues involved in using religious texts?**
• Objects of sacred importance to some; respectful use
• Misinterpretation or translation by the program
• Types of interpretation to use? Literal (word for word) or
dynamic (sense for sense)?
• Copyright law violation
##### d) User testing
• Project might involve getting user feedback on a system
being designed, developed, or evaluated.
• For example:
	• Testing the usability of a graphical user interface
	• Evaluating whether a visualization technique helps people to
understand and interpret data more easily
• Obtaining this feedback might involve: observation,
questionnaires, or interviews

• You must provide each participant with an information
sheet fully detailing the project, the data that will be
collected, how the data will be stored and used.
• You must assure users that they can leave at any time, to
avoid coercion.
• When appropriate, the user will complete a written consent
form.
• No sensitive information will be recorded, and any personal
information will be securely stored.
##### e) Use of data from the internet
• Your project might involve analysis of data collected from
the internet
• For instance:
	• Publicly available databases, eg. government data could be
	analyzed to identify trends and patterns
	• Data about website use may be analyzed to extract trends
##### f) Working with NHS staff
