### Outline
We'll be looking at ethical issues that might arise in your projects and how to manage these.
1. Two common issues in computing projects
	a) Consent
	b) Privacy and anonymity
2. Six areas of block ethical approval
	a) Images of people
	b) Medical images
	c) Use of religious texts
	d) User testing
	e) Use of data from the internet
	f) Working with NHS staff
3. Applying this to a case study

##### Consent
Each person has a right to control their body, property, and who has access to these.
• Includes access to data, which is property of the subject and is about them.
• Consent is a kind of permission-giving; it often, but not perhaps always, makes an act ethically permissible.
• Securing a person’s consent before collecting or accessing their data is important for respecting their autonomy and boundaries.
• Sometimes people can’t consent due to mental impairment, e.g. very old and very young.
• A person does not properly consent to something if they are pressured into agreeing or do not understand what they are agreeing to.
• So, consent must be:
	• Free
	• Informed
• If your project involves collecting data about users, this presents a risk.
• In that case, you must have the informed consent of users.
• Fully informed about what their data is used for, and what data is collected.
##### Privacy and Anonymity
Consent is also important because it relates to privacy.
• Privacy is important:
• For individuality of thought and expression
• For freedom from control
• For regulating boundaries in relationships
• For control over who experiences us
• Lack of privacy hinders human flourishing in fiction (George Orwell’s 1984) and totalitarian regimes (eg. North Korea).
If data identifies a person, then it is personal data.
• Collecting personal data creates a risk of harm:
• Discrimination (belonging to oppressed groups; religion, sexuality, ethnicity)
• Social disadvantages (mental health history, criminal record)
• Identity fraud, targeted marketing, harassment
• Violating someone’s choice/autonomy: should be up to individuals
what data is collected about them
