Iann Sommervile has a section of security. 

Must always identify the motive and entry points: 1. method and 2. opportunity 3. motive. Identifying existing vulnerabilities or unknown due to loosely or even undefined specifications.

A threat is a set of circumstances that has the potential to cause harm or loss.

4 main types of threats
	Interception: Gaining access to an asset(s)
	Interruption: Preventing access to an asset(s)
	Modification: Tampering of an asset(s)
	Fabrication: Addition of nonexistent item(s)

Means of control
	Prevention: Remove all vulnerabilities
	
Why is security hard
	Humans make mistakes
	It is not easily quantified and there is no scoring system, emergent system property or real 	measure of secure.
