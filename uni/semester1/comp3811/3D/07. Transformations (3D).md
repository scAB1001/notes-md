Mostly relates to the vertex processing stage, shaders too (also extra metadata relatead to input data)

 Code highlighted in yellow has changed (now using 4x4 matrix and vector of 4 too)
 What does `uModelViewProjection` represent?

### Relevant topics
- Handedness of coordinate systems
- Constructing matrices
- Hierarchical transformations
## Spaces
Chair example in model (local) space, give it (0, 0, 0) vertex positions (v_model)

Now put it into world space: positions for each vertex. 
v_world = m_world * v_model

Instancing:
Single object (e.g., this chair) placed multiple times in the scene.
Each instance has a different transformation, but only store one copy of the object’s data.
v_world = m'_world * v_model

View/eye/camera space. Position relative to camera using a transformation
v_camera = m_camera * v_modelworld

**NEGATIVE COORDINATES ARE IN FRONT OF YOU.**
