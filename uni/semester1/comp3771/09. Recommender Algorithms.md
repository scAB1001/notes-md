### Recommender Systems
Main types of recommender algorithms
- Collaborative or social recommenders
	- Suggestion lists, “top-n” offers and promotions
- Content-based recommenders
	- E-mail filters, clipping services
- Knowledge-based recommenders
	- Buying guides for cars, or houses
- Hybrid recommenders
	- Combination of any of the above
#### Collaborative Filtering (CF)
- Recommends items to the user based on what other similar users have liked (e.g. people like you prefer this, you may like it as well)
- How to find other user’s preferences?
- Explicit methods (ratings –MovieLens/Netflix, Amazon)
- Implicit methods (observations – what they buy, what they visit – less reliable)

 Other’s ratings
 What others like
 My ratings
 What I like
Give me what people similar to me would like … “Word of mouth” “Voting”
#### Step 1: Input data for the example

*Example of building data vector*

1-5 is dislikes-like, 0 is we don't know as they haven't interacted with the system.
#### Step 2: Find nearest neighbours
**2.1. Find similarity with each person**
**2.2. Define neighbourhood**
Sometimes referred to as “K-nearest neighbour user-user collaborative filtering”
