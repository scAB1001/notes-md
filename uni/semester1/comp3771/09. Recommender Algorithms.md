### Recommender Systems
Main types of recommender algorithms
 Collaborative or social recommenders
 Suggestion lists, “top-n” offers and promotions
 Content-based recommenders
 E-mail filters, clipping services
 Knowledge-based recommenders
 Buying guides for cars, or houses
 Hybrid recommenders
 Combination of any of the above

Collaborative Filtering (CF)
 Recommends items to the user based on what
other similar users have liked (e.g. people like
you prefer this, you may like it as well)
 How to find other user’s preferences?
 Explicit methods (ratings –MovieLens/Netflix, Amazon)
 Implicit methods (observations – what they buy, what
they visit – less reliable)
