Objective: Predict the survival of the passengers aboard RMS Titanic.
Dataset: Titanic DataSet
- provides the data on all the passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic when it sank on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic ocean.
- a combination of variables based on personal characteristics such as age, class of ticket and gender, and tests one’s classification skills.
- 891 rows and 12 columns
### What is Data?
“A datum is a single measurement of something on a scale that is understandable to both the recorder and the reader. Data are multiple such measurements.”
#### What type of data? Key Data Properties
##### Structure -- the “shape” of a data file
- e.g. Tab separated values
- A common table file format.
- Records are delimited by a newline: '\n', "\r\n"
- Fields are delimited by '\t' (tab)
- pd.read_csv: Need to specify delimiter='\t'
- ![[non-rectangular-data.png]]
##### Granularity -- how fine/coarse is each datum
Singular people as data-points vs groups
##### Scope --how (in)complete is the data
Will my data be enough to answer my question?
- Example: I am interested in studying crime in California but
- I only have Berkeley crime data.
- Solution: collect more data/change research question

Is my data too broad?
- Example: I am interested in student grades for Algorithms but have student grades for all Algorithms classes (grad + undergrad).
- Solution: Filtering ⇒ Implications on sample?

If the data is a sample I may have poor coverage after filtering (More on this next week)

 Does my data cover the right time frame? Which brings us to Temporality
- Temporality -- how is the data situated in time
###### Data changes – when was the data collected/last updated?
Periodicity — Is there periodicity? Diurnal (24-hr) patterns?
What is the meaning of the time and date fields? A few options:
- When the “event” happened?
- When the data was collected or was entered into the system?
- Date the data was copied into a database? (look for many matching timestamps)
##### Faithfulness -- how well does the data capture “reality”
Does my data contain unrealistic or “incorrect” values?
- Dates in the future for events in the past
- Locations that don’t exist
- Negative counts
- Misspellings of names
- Large outliers

Does my data violate obvious dependencies?
- E.g., age and birthday don’t match
- Was the data entered by hand?
- Spelling errors, fields shifted …

Did the form require all fields or provide default values?
- Are there obvious signs of data falsification?
- Repeated names, fake looking email addresses, repeated use of uncommon names or fields.
#### How is the data stored? 
How is your data represented and stored (data format)?
- Tabular Data: a dataset that is a two-dimensional table, where each row typically represents a single data record, and each column represents one type of measurement (csv, dat, xlsx, etc.).
- Structured Data: each data record is presented in a form of a [possibly complex and multi-tiered] dictionary (json, xml, etc.)
- Semi-structured Data: not all records are represented by the same set of keys or some data records are not represented using the key-value pair structure

What type of data? 
What kind of values are in your data (data types)?
Simple or atomic:
- Numeric: integers, floats
- Boolean: binary or true false values
- Strings: sequence of symbols

What kind of values are in your data (data types)? 
Compound, composed of a bunch of atomic types:
- Date and time: compound value with a specific structure
- Lists: a list is a sequence of values
- Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, a pair of values x : y where x is usually a string called the key representing the “name” of the entry, and y is a value of any type.

Example: Student record: what are x and y?
- First and Last name: Kevin Rader
- Classes: [CS-109A, STAT139]
#### Hierarchy of data-categories for a variable
Quantitative: Continuous or Discrete
Qualitative: Ordinal or Nominal

Examples for each: **TODO**
Many variables do not sit neatly in one of these categories!

### HW
Main reading: “Adaptive interfaces and agents” by Anthony Jameson. In Human-Computer Interaction: Design Issues, Solutions, and Applications.  pages 1-15 from the paper)

The tasks will help you gain a deeper understanding of the general schema of user-adaptive system

Read the section about LILSYS and note:
- What information is collected about the user
- Can there be any concerns regarding the information collected about users

Can you give examples of contemporary systems which are similar to LILSYS

Read the section about the AGENTSALON and note:
- Can you give examples of contemporary systems which are similar to AGENTSALON
- Identify three similarities between LILSYS and AGENTSALON
- Identify three differences between LILSYS and AGENTSALON
