### Tell us about a time when you "hacked the system" to your advantage (Do not use AI / CHATGPT)
As part of one of my roles in PwC, I took on an ongoing project that concerned Carbon Emission data processing via client API. The actual collection was very tedious, needing to submit requests for access for each call to the API through the company's internal network, receive confirmation, submit the call, then repeat. The process required forms filling in, email chains as confirmation and evidence, and so on.

I noticed many of these steps were often duplicated and that the entire process was in dire need of automation. After lots of policy reading, confirmation from my manager and testing, I discovered that I could send multiple identical API access requests upfront, using the same data for each one if appropriate. Furthermore, the emails and authorisation process could be sent in bulk and events triggered based on email response which always contained the same keywords and sign-off, which I treated as a unique "trigger key", so to speak.

The results were pleasing: a speed-up in overall project growth and development due to immediate upfront access with little-to-no input required from developers -which previously took from their programming/design time, a routine and tidy collection of confirmation, creating an organised paper trail -unlike previous documentation which meant that each requester would store the sign-offs independently as a sole responsibility and there was no uniform, centralised system.

I consider this hacking the system because I leveraged parts of the existing system in ways previously not considered and essentially automated laborious parts of the role for the better to enable more time and focus on important jobs.
### Tell us about something you've done in the past that can be considered as evidence of exceptional ability (Do not use AI / CHATGPT)
I created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and trained it to process images of guitar tab notation and then translate the data into a format I am more comfortable with. 

This worked amazingly because it meant I did not need to learn music theory or the location of each note on the fret-board in different tunings; simply treating the notes as fret and string like coordinates - which is much more digestible for me as a beginner guitarist.

After completing the initial workflow, I automated steps along the way, making a web application to submit both images directly and links to guitar tab pages that contained the tabs images. This application saves me lots of time when learning songs as before I would manually type out each (fret, string).

33. # Software Engineer

London, England, United Kingdom

We’re looking for experienced Software Engineer to join our growing team in Central London, working on a new product to help make a big impact to our customers by removing manual processes in their finance team. You will have the opportunity to help ship premium products to our clients quicker, plus seeing the impact of your code on our 5000+ businesses we work with.  
**  
Tipalti Engineering**

Tipalti’s engineering teams are the driving force behind our success. Our technology ecosystem is rich, complex, and constantly evolving as we continue to ship new features and scale our platform globally.

You’ll be joining a team that combines the pace and ownership of a startup with the stability and impact of a global fintech leader. We encourage curiosity, thoughtful debate, and pragmatic engineering—while always keeping the customer at the centre of what we build.

At Tipalti, you’ll collaborate with a diverse, international group of engineers, product managers, and designers who are collectively shaping the future of financial operations.

As a Software Engineer, you’ll play a key role in expanding Tipalti’s product offering into new areas. You’ll work in a cross-functional squad alongside Product and Design to shape ideas, turn them into scalable solutions, and deliver high-quality software end to end.

You’ll contribute across the stack, including backend APIs and services, to deliver new functionality that directly improves how our customers manage expenses and procurement at scale.

Our current tech stack includes React, Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript. That said, our interview process is technology-agnostic. We care far more about strong engineering fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and the ability to learn quickly than prior experience with a specific framework.

We operate a hybrid working model, with three days a week in our Central London office (Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday).  
**  
What You’ll Do**

- Design, build, and maintain end-to-end features for our new team.
    
- Collaborate closely with Product Managers and Designers to shape technical and product decisions
    
- Develop and evolve backend APIs and microservices to support new and existing functionality
    
- Write clean, well-tested, and scalable code across the full stack
    
- Take an active role in code reviews, design discussions, and pair programming
    
- Contribute to a highly collaborative environment where we learn, build, and succeed together
    

**About You  
**

- You’re passionate about learning, sharing knowledge, and improving how teams work
    
- You enjoy collaborating with engineers and cross-functional partners, both in person and remotely
    
- You take ownership and pride in delivering high-quality, reliable solutions
    
- You care deeply about good system design, testing, and long-term maintainability
