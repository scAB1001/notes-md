# 01. Intro
## Security Goals & Properties
- Data confidentiality
- Data integrity: No modification, insertion, deletion or replay
- High availability: Amazon systems aer available 99.9% of the year
- Authenticity: Data sources and system users
- Access control
- Trustworthy system logs

## Attackers follow the M.O.M. acronym 
**Method**: They have the skills and tools to attack the systems and potentially have information about it.
**Opportunity**: They have a time/chance and the acces to carry out this attack e.g., systems can be accessed remotely.
**Motive**: They have a reason to attack e.g., Financial or Political.
### Assets and Adversaries 
To identify assets, you must analyse the system and the user themselves e.g., A photo of a celebrity is considered an asset, whereas a photo of a non-famous person might not be. Likewise, user data is considered an asset as it's exposure can lead to financial gain.

An adversary is the perpetrator with their eyes on the asset.
### Vulnerabilities
For attacks to be possible there must be vulnerabilities. These occur when system specifications or conditions are loosely defined e.g., buffer overflows (unspecified buffer size) and SQL Injection attacks.
### Threats
A threat is a set of circumstances that has the *potential* to cause *harm or loss*.
### Problem
A problem exists when there is both a threat and a vulnerability.
If the vulnerability can be controlled the then threat can be contained e.g., a *vulnerability* of unprotected data can be *mitigated* via the enabling of access control.
## Threats and Controls
Four main types of threats:
1. Interception: Gaining access to an asset.
2. Interruption: Preventing access to an asset.
3. Modification: Tampering of an asset.
4. Fabrication: Addition of nonexistent items.

Four main types of controls:
1. Prevention: Remove all vulnerabilities.
2. Deferral: Deal with the vulenrability.
3. Deflection: Change the nature of the asset e.g., data may be moved from on-site to cloud.
4. Detection: Controls to observe the attacks.
5. Recovery: Moving on from attacks.
## Why is security hard
- Humans make mistakes (**PEBKAC**: Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair)
- Assumptions are made incorrectly
- It is not easily quantified and there is no scoring system or real measure of secure.
- Emergent system properties are unpredictable.
## Hackers
- Originally defined as someone who enjoys understanding and tinkering with software or hardware.
- Different types:
	- White Hat: Uses skills ethically.
	- Black Hat: Uses skills unethically.
# 01. Threat modelling
Threat modelling is the *process* of *identifying* the *possible threats* to a system. 
It allows us to understand the capabilities of attackers and their threats which will endanger the security policies in place. This approach is cost-effective as it avoids mistakes/future threats that are alike.
##### Bellovin’s Threat Matrix → ![[bellovin-threat-matrix.png]]
#### Advanced Persistent Threats
- Highly skilled attackers
- Targeted and prolonged cyber-attack campaigns
- Complex, multidimensional attacks, often tightly focused and very difficult to deflect (e.g., **Stuxnet**)
- ‘Cyber-warfare’ involving ‘state actors’ (e.g., national intelligence agencies)
### Security Engineering
The design process for security follows threat modelling, security requirement building and security mechanism development.
The thread model allows security designers to estimate the stregnth of the attacker.
## Main steps for threat Modelling
### 1. System Characterisation 
Characterise the system into main modules to see the system's data flow.
To understand the system components and their interconnections, define:
- Usage scenarios
- Assumptions
- Dependencies

and model:
- Data flow diagrams
- The Network
- State machines
- At varying granularity e.g. APIs, classes or methods.
### 2. Asset and Access Point Identification 
Identify assets and access points to understand how a user would access the system.
- What are we trying to protect?
- How can we reach the system and asset?
### 3. Threat Identification 
Identify any threats. Threats to different components will differ.
Assets can be reached via access points through components and their interaconnections.
Develop a threat profile for each threat (classified as high or low risk).
#### Threat Enumeration
Threats can come from both outside and in.
For each asset, attack goals need to be made for the asset.
The adversary type can be discovered by correlating threats to assets.
#### Attack Trees
A conceptual tree structure used to show how an asset can be attacked (the root node).
Each node represents a condition/predicate/action. E.g., Pick lock (*Impossible*), Learn combination (*Possible*)->Get from staff->Blackmail, Learn combination (*P*)->Get from staff->Bribe.
