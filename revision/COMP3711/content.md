# Lecture 1: Introduction 
## 1. Core Definition & Scope
> **Data Science** is a multidisciplinary field using principles, algorithms, and processes to extract **nonobvious and useful patterns** from **large data sets**. It encompasses the full **data lifecycle**: capture, cleaning, analysis, modelling, and presentation.

* **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset focused on algorithmic pattern extraction.
* **Data Mining** typically analyses structured data for discovery.
* **Data Science** includes **unstructured data** (e.g., social media), **big-data technologies**, and **data ethics**.
## 2. Datafication
> **Datafication** is the process of taking all aspects of life and turning them into **quantifiable data**. Once datafied, information can be repurposed into new forms of value.

**Example**: A **fitness tracker** datafies sleep, movement, and heart rate. The resulting data allows a user to derive **actionable insights**, such as linking poor sleep quality to late-night screen time, which would be difficult to notice otherwise.
## 3. Key Skills of a Data Scientist
* **Technical**: Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Machine Learning.
* **Domain Expertise**: Understanding the specific field (e.g., healthcare, film).
* **Soft Skills**: Communication, Presentation, **Data Visualisation**.
## 4. Core Process & Workflow
1.  **Data Collection & Preparation**: **Collecting, Curating, Cleaning**. The most time-consuming phase.
2.  **Analysis & Modelling**: **Visualize, Analyze, Model (Machine Learning)**.
3.  **Critical Questions Before Modelling**:
    * Does the **past represent the future**? (Assumption for predictive models).
    * What is the **goal** of the model?
    * How will it be **used**?
    * What data is **needed** vs. **available**?
## 5. Example Applications
* **IMDb**: Structured, crowdsourced data enabling questions on actor careers, film success factors (**correlation** between budget/ratings), and societal trends (e.g., age disparity between actors/actresses).
* **Gapminder**: Uses **GDP per capita** (a **metric** for national wealth) to analyse relationships with health outcomes like life expectancy, demonstrating **exploratory data analysis**.
## 6. Historical Context & Greater Data Science (GDS)
* **50-Year Foundation**: Roots in statistics (Tukey, Cleveland) advocating for a broader **data analysis** science beyond theory.
* **Lesser Data Science (LDS)**: Current, narrow commercial focus on **big-data** tools and scalability.
* **Greater Data Science (GDS)**: Donoho's proposed rigorous framework with six divisions:
    1.  Data Exploration & Preparation.
    2.  Data Representation & Transformation.
    3.  Computing with Data.
    4.  Data Modelling (includes both **statistical inference** and **predictive modelling**).
    5.  Data Visualisation & Presentation.
    6.  **Science about Data Science**: Empirical study of data analysis methods themselves.
* **Common Task Framework (CTF)**: Key driver of ML progress; uses public **benchmarks**, shared data, and objective scoring to compare algorithms.
## 7. Core Objectives & Values
* **Primary Goal**: Derive **actionable insights**, not just numbers. Requires asking the **right questions**.
* **Statistical Reasoning Values**: Understanding the **application domain**, appreciating the **small** (details matter), quest for **significance**, hunger for **exploration**.
* **Future Direction**: Evolution towards **evidence-based methodology** via **Science about Data Science**, using meta-analysis of computational research to improve methods.
