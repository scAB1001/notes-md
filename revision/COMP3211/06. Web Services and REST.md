#### Distributed Computing Paradigms & Web Services
• First
– We linked all machines together - > Internet
– Needed TCP/IP
• Second
– we linked all documents together - >WWW
– Needed HTTP, HTML, XML
• Third
– we linked all applications together
– Service Oriented Architectures -> Web services
– Needed
• REST (Representational State Transfer)
#### Why Do We Need Web Services?
• ‘Screen scraping’ a Website, i.e., treating it like a
remote database is (still) popular
– but is inherently unreliable
– there is a need to query Web resources programmatically
• DS technologies must support industry requirements
• Industry has moved rapidly to adoption of data
encoding formats for describing and exchanging data,
e.g.
– XML (Extensible Markup Language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
• DS technology based on these formats is attractive.
#### What are Web Services?
• A Web service is a piece of business logic, located
on the Internet or on an intranet, accessed using
e.g. standard XML, over standard protocols such
as HTTP or SMTP
• Web services do not replace other DS
technologies
– more coarse-grained approach to exposing and
advertising enterprise services hosted on existing
platforms such as JEE, .NET, etc.
• Web services allow us to build larger-scale,
loosely-coupled DS without constraining
technology used to develop system components.
#### Why Use XML For Structuring
and Exchanging Data?
• Easily extended
• Allows data to be self-describing
• Text-based, therefore portable and human-friendly
• Standard and non-proprietary
<employee>
<firstname>John</firstname>
<lastname>Smith</lastname>
</employee>
#### Why Use JSON For Structuring
and Exchanging Data?
• JSON: JavaScript Object Notation is
– lightweight text-data interchange format
– language independent
– "self-describing“
– Easy to understand
{
"employees": [
{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },
{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },
{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" }
]
}
#### Service Oriented Architecture
• Web services support
development of a highly-
distributed, Service-Oriented
Architecture (SOA); each WS
is a self-contained, self-
describing modular unit
participating in a larger
ecosystem.
• Three roles for participants in an SOA:
– Provider, who publishes a service via a broker
– Requestor, who uses the broker to find, then bind to, a service
– Broker, acting as a ‘Yellow Pages’ directory for services
Example: Finding (REST) APIs:
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer
![[soa-web-services.png]]
##### Example: Book a Flight and Car
1. Runs a booking system on Oracle Solaris
2. Runs website and online booking system on Linux Dell Servers
1.WS Client->2.WS
Although the systems have different h/w and s/w, they can be loosely
coupled with WS, to the business benefit of both companies.
True SOA takes this a stage further, allowing for **dynamic discovery** of
services via brokerage.

• Platform and implementation independent -Meaning that a client can not tell what language, operating system, or computer platform was used. A software components that can be:
– Described using a service description language, Meaning that a Web Service must describe itself:
◼ What requests can be made,
◼ What the arguments are,
◼ What transport it uses
– Published to a registry of services, Meaning that a Web Service must tell a registry service where it is located (like "yellow pages").
– Discovered through a standard mechanism (at runtime or design time), Meaning that a potential client can find it in a registry service.
– Invoked through a declared API, usually over a network Meaning that the arguments and return types are known
– Composed with other services Meaning that a service can also be a client.
(FEATURES) Standardise the packaging of information for transport
– E.g. over HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc, using XML, JSON …
• Support modes of communication
– e.g. synchronous (RPC-style) and asynchronous (document transfer)
• Provide an interoperability abstraction of conventional RPC /
RMI
#### Resource-based Architectures
Essence: view a distributed system as a **collection of resources**,
individually managed by components. Resources may be added,
removed, retrieved, and modified by (remote) applications.
• Resources are identified through a single naming scheme
• All services offer the same interface
• Messages sent to or from a service are fully self-described
• After executing an operation at a service, that component forgets
everything about the caller
Approach adopted in Representational State Transfer (**REST**) Web
services, with the following basic operations

| Operation | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST      | Create a new resource                                   |
| GET       | Retrieve the state of a resource in some representation |
| DELETE    | Delete a resource                                       |
| PUT       | Modify a resource by transferring new state             |
REST is an architectural style for DS
What Does REST Consist of?
• The uniform interface features a constrained
set of well-defined operations and a
constrained set of content types.
• REST uses a protocol that is client/server,
stateless, cacheable and layered.
• The REST methodology is identical to the
way in which a Web browser gets Web
pages from or posts to a web server.
• An example...
##### In Practice... (I)
• A Web page is a resource. So is a jpeg picture file
located on that Web page. So are any links, sound files
• Resources are accessible using a universal syntax – the
URI.
– URIs are assigned to individual data records, customer records,
and orders, as transferred between a Web Service and a Client.
https ://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?**method**=flickr.photos.getinfo&**photoID**=1234
![[rest-ex.png]]The well-defined operations supported by REST
resources are simply HTTP verbs, the most
important of which are GET, POST, PUT and
DELETE.
• Used to issue a request to a REST Web Service to
access and manipulate the server-side state, or
data record, identified by the URI.
• These verbs can be seen as being similar to the
CRUD operations associated with DBMS.
– GET = READ or COPY
– PUT = UPDATE or PASTE OVER
– POST = CREATE or PASTE AFTER
– DELETE = DELETE or CUT
The “REST triangle”
![[rest-triangle.png]]
- REST is not a standard – it’s an architectural style,
although it does prescribe the use of standards
(HTTP, URI, XML/HTML/JPEG etc)
#### Why is it called "Representation State Transfer"?
The Client references a Web resource using a URL. A representation
of the resource is returned (in this case as an HTML document).
The representation (e.g., Boeing787.html) places the client application in
a state. The result of the client traversing a hyperlink in Boeing787.html
in another resource is accessed. The new representation places the client
application into yet another state. Thus, the client application changes (transfers)
state with each resource representation --> Representation State Transfer!

#### The REST way of Implementing the Web Services
Consider a Parts Depot Web Service, which allows its customers to:
1. Get a list of parts
2. Get detailed information about a particular part
3. Submit a purchase order (PO)
![[rest-purchase-order-ex.png]]
Get a list of parts
• A RESTful web service makes a URI
available to its parts list resource. So
you’d access something like:
http://www.parts-depot.com/parts
• If the service wishes to specify what
type of document the user wants…
http://www.parts-depot.com/parts?flavour=xml
Data Returned - Parts List (III)
```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<p:Parts xmlns:p="http://www.parts-depot.com"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation=
"http://www.parts-depot.com
http://www.parts-depot.com/parts.xsd">
<Part id="00345" xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345"/>
<Part id="00346" xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00346"/>
<Part id="00347" xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00347"/>
<Part id="00348" xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00348"/>
</p:Parts>
```
Note that the parts list has links to get detailed info about each part.
This is a key feature of REST. The client transfers from one state to
the next by examining and choosing from among the alternative URLs
in the response document.
(EXAMPLE) Get information about a particular part
• The RESTful Web Service makes available a URI to each part resource, such as:
http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345?flavour=xml
• This is a logical URI – it expresses what resource is desired. It is not a physical object. You don’t need a million HTML pages if you have a million parts.
Data Returned:
```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<p:Part xmlns:p="http://www.parts-depot.com"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation=
"http://www.parts-depot.com
http://www.parts-depot.com/part.xsd">
<Part-ID>00345</Part-ID>
<Name>Widget-A</Name>
<Description>This part is used within the frap assembly</Description>
<Specification xlink:href="http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345/specification"/>
<UnitCost currency="USD">0.10</UnitCost>
<Quantity>10</Quantity>
</p:Part>
```
Observe how this data is linked to still more data - the specification
for this part may be found by traversing the hyperlink. Each response
document allows the client to drill down to get more detailed information.
The REST way of Implementing
the Web Service (V)
• Service: Submit a Purchase Order (PO)
– The web service makes available a URL to submit a PO.
The client creates a PO instance document which
conforms to the PO schema that Parts Depot has
designed (and publicised in a WSDL document). The
client submits PO.xml as the payload of an HTTP POST.
