#### Goals: 
understand principles behind naming in a distributed system
#### Outline
• Structured naming
– Namespaces
– Name resolution
– Implementation of a namespace
Examples
• Attribute-based naming
• Directory Services
• Conclusion
#### Flat vs Structured Naming
• Flat names are
– good for machines
– generally not very convenient for humans to use
• Alternative:
– Naming systems support structured names that are composed from single, human-readable names
– File naming, host naming on the Internet follows this approach.
• Next
– Explore how structured names and the way that these names are resolved to addresses.
#### Namespaces
• A **namespace** is the collection of all valid names recognised by a particular service.
• Namespaces for structured names can be represented as a directed graph with **leaf** nodes (no outgoing edges) and **directory** **nodes** (labelled outgoing edges).
• Leaf nodes store entity attributes or state of entity itself; directory nodes store a **directory table** of outgoing edges.
• Each path in naming graph can be identified by sequence of labels associated with edges in the path: N : {L1, L2, …, Ln}

*A directory node contains a table of (node identifier, edge label) pairs*

We can easily store all kinds of attributes in a node
• Type of the entity
• An identifier for that entity
• Address of the entity’s location
• Nicknames …

*Naming Graph with a Single Root Node*
#### Name Resolution
• **Name resolution**: is the process of looking up a name
• Problem: To resolve a name we need a directory node. How do we actually find that (initial) node?
• **Closure mechanism**: The mechanism to select the implicit context from which to start name resolution
Examples:
– www.distributed-systems.net: start at a DNS name server
– /home/maarten/mbox: start at the local NFS file server (possible recursive search)
– 0031 20 598 7784: dial a phone number
– 77.167.55.6: route message to a specific IP address
#### Closure Mechanism (Unix)
• Name resolution possible only if we know how and where to start, i.e. need some way of selecting initial node (**index node**).
• In a UNIX file system, we exploit fact that the **inode** of the root directory is first inode of logical disk, and that its byte offset can be computed from information in disk’s superblock.
![[closure-mechanism-unix-ex.png]]
*To resolve /home/steen/mbox : necessary to have access to the directory table of the root node.*
#### File Structures and Name Resolution (Unix)
Every file and directory is represented by an **inode**
• Contains two kinds of information:
1. **Metadata** describing the file's owner, access rights, etc.
2. **Location** of the file's blocks on disk
• A **directory** is a flat file of fixed-size entries
	• Each entry consists of an inode number and a file name
##### Pathname Resolution
To look up a pathname “/etc/passwd”, start at root directory and walk down chain of inodes
![[inode-ex.png]]

#### Linking
• We can create **aliases** for a named entity, corresponding to links in the naming graph:
![[linking-unix-ex.png]]
– Can have multiple *absolute* pathnames referring to same node (‘**hard link**’ in UNIX filesystem terminology)
– Can have leaf node of alias store the *absolute* pathname of the aliased entity (‘**symbolic link**’)
#### Mounting
• Name resolution can be used to merge **different** **namespaces** in a transparent way through **mounting**: associating a node identifier of another name space with a node in a current name space.
• Terminology
– **Foreign name space**: the name space that needs to be accessed
– **Mount point**: the node in the current name space containing the node identifier of the foreign name space
– **Mounting point**: the node in the foreign name space where to continue name resolution
• Mounting across a network
– The name of an access protocol
– The name of the server
– The name of the mounting point in the foreign name space.

*Mounting remote name spaces through a specific access protocol Resolve name /remote/vu/mbox*
#### Namespace Implementation
Basic issue
• Distribute the name resolution process as well as name space management across multiple machines, by distributing nodes of the naming graph.
Distinguish three levels
• **Global** level: Consists of the high-level directory nodes. Main aspect is that these directory nodes have to be jointly managed by different administrations
• **Administrational** level: Contains mid-level directory nodes that can be grouped in such a way that each group can be assigned to a separate administration.
• **Managerial** level: Consists of low-level directory nodes within a single administration. Main issue is effectively mapping directory nodes to local name servers.

##### Name Space Implementation

A comparison between name servers for implementing nodes from a large-scale name space partitioned into a global layer, as an administrational layer, and a managerial layer.
Domain Name System (DNS)
Computer Browser requests to visit http://aws.amazon.com.
1. How do I get to aws.amazon.com?
2. The IP address is not in my cache. Will contact another DNS server
3. I have the IP address. It maps to 52.46.157.11
.5 . Thanks. Get to Web site through 52.46.157.11
.4  Thanks. I will send it to the client and cache it for future use
![[dns-aws-ex.png]]
##### DNS Zone Data
• Attribute data for names in a domain
• Names and IP addresses of at least two name servers with
authoritative data for the zone.
• Names and IP addresses of name servers holding authoritative data for
delegated sub-domains
• Parameters governing the caching and replication of zone data.
• Any name server is free to cache data from others, with proviso that
client is told such data are non-authoritative.
• Each entry in a zone has a time to live; cached data will be provided to
clients for up to this time, after which an authoritative server must be
contacted to check the entry.
##### DNS: Information in a Node
SOA: Start of Authority NS: Name Server
A: Address CNAME: Canonical name
MX: Mail Exchange PTR: Pointer
SRV: Name of Server HINFO: Host Information
![[dns-node-info.png]]Name Resolution (Navigation) methods to Resolve name <nl, vu, cs, ftp>
• Iterative
– Root server will resolve the path name as far as it can, and return the result to the client
– Client passes remaining pathname to the next name server
![[dns-iterative.png]]
• Recursive
– Name server passes the result to the next name server it finds.
![[recursive-ex.png]]
##### Which is Better?
• Recursive resolution places greater demands on each
name server—so servers requiring high throughput (e.g., in
global layer) may support only iterative resolution.
• Caching in recursive resolution is more effective, because
each name server will gradually learn addresses of name
servers handling lower-level nodes.
• With iterative resolution, caching is necessarily limited to
client’s name resolver, so other clients can’t get benefit.
• Compromise is to have a local naming server shared by all
clients.
##### Scalability Issues: Communication Costs
The comparison between recursive and iterative name resolution with
respect to communication costs
– Need to ensure that the name resolution process scales across large
**geographical distances**
![[scalability-issues.png]]
##### Attribute-based Naming: Directory Services
• DNS is a traditional naming service
– Given a name it resolves to a node in the naming graph
– Returns that node
– Conceptually it is equivalent to a person using a telephone directory
• e.g. they give the name and get the telephone number
• A directory service is a different approach
– Implemented as a (distributed) database
– A description is stored at a node and a partial description can be
used to retrieve (possibly multiple) nodes
– Lookup entities by means of their attributes
– Conceptually it is like a person using yellow pages.
• e.g. some piece of information is given, like a profession, and an
appropriate list of telephone numbers are returned.
• Question: can lookup operations be expensive?
##### LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
• LDAP, implemented directly on top of TCP, provides a simple
protocol for accessing services over the Internet.
• Seen as a standard for Internet-based directory services.
• Microsoft’s Active Directory Service has an LDAP interface
– Active Directory: designed to centralise large company networks into
one repository where administrators can manage easily
• is an example of MS Outlook contacts
• Outlook stores contact information and attributes to search such as
name and email address.
![[ldap-ex.png]]
Each directory entry consists of (attribute, value) pairs, and is uniquely named to ease lookups.

| Attribute           | Abbreviation | Value       |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Country             | C            | UK          |
| Locality            | L            | Leeds       |
| Organisation        | O            | Leeds Uni   |
| Organisational Unit | OU           | Computing   |
| CommonName          | N            | Main Server |
| Mail_Servers        | -            |             |
| FTP_Server          | -            |             |
| WWW_Server          | -            |             |
