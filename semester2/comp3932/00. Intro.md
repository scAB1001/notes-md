#### General
1. Find a supervisor
2. Align it with your specification and speak to career coach, manager, tutor, etc
3. Core component must be a computer science problem
4. The project must contain some coded implementation, demonstrating your projectâ€™s work but this is not the focus (it can be a small amount)
5. Book supervisor meetings every 2 weeks (minimum) no matter what and prepare for them as best as possible. Think SEP meetings.

Create a GitHub repo:
- Wiki for documentation
- Code repo
- Planning boards
- Actions for tests

There will be an Ethical section

Referring to point 5, come prepared to each meeting with the mark scheme as bullet points/questions

Per week spend 10 hours on your project.

Formal deadline
Preference form in week 1

Short written form on gradescope in week 6.
### Thurday 23/10/2025
- Make Whatsapp gc for group meetings (that will occaisionally happen)
- How you communicate yourself, the project and details within
- 2 missing - how to add them to gc?
#### Projects
- other phds students available
##### Project1: Deep federated learning for tacling class imbalance and cross-domain challenges in medical imaging
**Challenges**
- high cost of data curation, demand of expertise
- privacy and regulatory concners
- domain shift and class imbalance problems
##### Project2: Deep learning to detect Gall Bladder Cancer in Ultrasound images
**Challenges**
- low image quality, noisy data -- difficulty detecing gall bladder cancer
- aim: explore ai techniques to detect gal bladder cancer in US Images
- nicely curated data, but proprietary (private)
##### Project3: Segmentation of organelles in noisy high-throughput images
Objective; Segment and quantify different subcellular structures acquired from Cryo-Electrong Tomography
##### Project4: AI for Endoscopic quality assessment
Issues with moving cameras.
##### Project5: Multimodal data analysis for cancer risk prognosis
- Already open-sourced models as starting points to be used for data sets
##### Project6: Stratify patients iwht cancer risks in the upper aerodigestive tract (nasal endoscopy)
- Publishable
##### Project7: Surgical tool detection and tracking
Challenge: optimise methods, data annotation
Aim: Optimise surgical tool detection and tracking methods for hardware in resource constrained environment. with PHD students.
##### Project8: Automatic segmentation for right hemicolectomy planning
As opposed to manual 3d modelling. From MRI scans. For vessels and organs.
If you have graphics background, build unity framework e.g. for user-friendly planning in 3d engine (you made)
_Theres an apple vision pro unity api so you can make ur own game_
##### Project9: Building an image classifier to predict therapy responsiveness and cancer staging from label-free coherent Raman images
Identify and classify cell-types. UoL Physics own data
##### Project10: Neuromorphic data analysis for ultra fast microfluidic imaging of cell deformation
Noise removal, imagery (1 or 2 out of the 4 goals). Publishable bc new
