#### General
1. Find a supervisor
2. Align it with your specification and speak to career coach, manager, tutor, etc
3. Core component must be a computer science problem
4. The project must contain some coded implementation, demonstrating your projectâ€™s work but this is not the focus (it can be a small amount)
5. Book supervisor meetings every 2 weeks (minimum) no matter what and prepare for them as best as possible. Think SEP meetings.

Create a GitHub repo:
- Wiki for documentation
- Code repo
- Planning boards
- Actions for tests

There will be an Ethical section

Referring to point 5, come prepared to each meeting with the mark scheme as bullet points/questions

Per week spend 10 hours on your project.

Formal deadline
Preference form in week 1

#### Projects
- other phds students available
##### Project1: Deep federated learning for tacling class imbalance and cross-domain challenges in medical imaging
**Challenges**
- high cost of data curation, demand of expertise
- privacy and regulatory concners
- domain shift and class imbalance problems
##### Project2: Deep learning to detect Gall Bladder Cancer in Ultrasound images
**Challenges**
- low image quality, noisy data -- difficulty detecing gall bladder cancer
- aim: explore ai techniques to detect gal bladder cancer in US Images
- nicely curated data, but proprietary (private)
##### Project3: Segmentation of organelles in noisy high-throughput images
Objective; Segment and quantify different subcellular structures acquired from Cryo-Electrong Tomography
#### Project4: AI for Endoscopic quality assessment
Issues with moving cameras.
#### Project5: Multimodal data analysis for cancer risk prognosis
